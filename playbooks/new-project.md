# Playbook: new project (greenfield)

> Adopt the autonomous-loop methodology in a fresh repo with a
> spec but little or no code. Estimated time: **2–3 hours** of
> setup before your first `/ship-a-phase` invocation, worked
> manually, section by section, at human reading pace. An
> autonomous agent delegated the whole playbook in one paste
> (README's TL;DR) has no read-and-decide pauses and typically
> finishes in well under an hour — that's the faster figure
> quoted there.
>
> By the end, you'll have:
> - A `spec.md` everyone trusts
> - A `plan/bearings.md` that locks the stack and conventions
> - A `plan/steps/01_build_plan.md` with 10–20 phases
> - Two phase briefs ready to ship (phase 1 + the canonical
>   sibling)
> - The skill set in `skills/` (count varies with which
>   adopt-by-need files you keep)
> - Slash-command pointers in `.claude/commands/`
> - 2–4 sub-agent definitions
> - A working verify gate (locally)
> - A working deploy gate (post-push)
> - `/ship-a-phase` ready to run

## Prerequisites

- A repo (empty or near-empty) initialized with `git init`.
- A `spec.md` describing what you're building. **One page is
  enough.** It needs: who the user is, what the product does,
  what's in scope for v1, what's deliberately out of scope.
  - If you have a pitch but no spec, run
    [`pre-spec.md`](./pre-spec.md) first — a 30-minute
    interactive session that produces `spec.md` and a
    `bearings.md` stub.
- A hosting provider you've picked (Netlify, Vercel, Fly.io,
  etc.). See [`ci-providers.md`](./ci-providers.md).
- Node 20+ installed, plus **pnpm**. The templates aren't just
  a naming convention: `templates/claude/settings.json`'s
  permission allowlist hardcodes `Bash(pnpm verify:*)`,
  `Bash(pnpm test:*)`, etc., so an unattended loop running
  npm/yarn/bun scripts stalls on a permission prompt every tick
  — the opposite of the walk-away pitch. If you must use a
  different package manager, sed-replace `pnpm` throughout the
  copied templates (mind `npm` needing `run` where `pnpm`
  doesn't) **and** add matching `Bash(<manager> <script>:*)`
  entries to `settings.json`'s `allow` list before your first
  unattended tick.
- A GitHub repo (or GitLab/equivalent) — push to `main`
  triggers deploy.

## The plan

You'll work through this top to bottom. Estimated time per
section in brackets.

1. Lock the spec [15 min]
2. Choose your stack and write `bearings.md` [30 min]
3. Choose your phases and write the build plan [30 min]
4. Copy templates and replace placeholders [15 min]
5. Write phase 1 brief in detail [20 min]
6. Wire the verify gate [20 min]
7. Wire the deploy gate [20 min]
8. Author 2–4 sub-agents [15 min]
9. (Optional) Run `/bootstrap` to provision external services [10–20 min]
10. Smoke-test by running `/ship-a-phase` once [15 min]
11. Ratchet up the autonomy [variable]

---

## 1. Lock the spec

Your `spec.md` is the anchor. Read it once now and ask yourself:

- **Is the v1 scope clear?** If you can't list 5–10 features that
  v1 must have, the spec is too vague.
- **Is the stack implied?** If the spec says "static editorial
  site," that's enough — bearings will fill in the framework.
  If it says "real-time collab tool," the stack matters more.
- **Is the audience specific?** "Developers" is too broad.
  "Backend engineers evaluating Postgres" is specific.
- **Are non-goals listed?** Explicit non-goals save 50 hours
  later.

Edit the spec until those four pass. Commit it.

---

## 2. Stack + bearings

Every `nexus/...` path below assumes the README's recommended
sibling clone (`../nexus`, next to your project root) —
adjust if you put your checkout somewhere else (e.g. `./.nexus`
if submoduled).

Copy `../nexus/templates/plan/bearings.md` to your repo's
`plan/bearings.md`.

Replace these placeholders:

- `<PROJECT>` → your product name (lowercase if applicable, e.g.
  `thock`)
- `<PROJECT_TAGLINE>` → one-line description
- `<HOSTING_URL>` → e.g. `https://thock.xyz`
- `<HOSTING_PROVIDER>` → Netlify / Vercel / etc.
- `<DEFAULT_BRANCH>` → usually `main`

Then fill in these sections:

### Stack pins

The "Stack (locked — do not re-litigate)" table. Pick:

- Framework (Next.js / SvelteKit / Astro / Remix / Django / etc.)
- Language (TypeScript strict / Python / Go)
- Styling (Tailwind / CSS modules / Vanilla / Emotion)
- Content layer (MDX-in-repo / headless CMS / database / none)
- Test runner (Vitest / Jest / Playwright / pytest)
- E2E (Playwright / Cypress)
- Lint + format (ESLint + Prettier / Biome / Ruff / etc.)
- Package manager (pnpm / npm / yarn / poetry / cargo)

Pick by what your team already knows. Don't optimize for the
methodology — the methodology is stack-agnostic.

### URL contract / API contract / output contract

The product's external contract — every URL the site serves,
every API endpoint, every CLI command. **Lock these on day one;
they're harder to change later than you think.**

For an editorial site: list every route.
For an API: list every endpoint with method + path.
For a CLI: list every subcommand.

### Visual / tonal defaults

If you have design exports, point at them. If not, write the
defaults: dark mode default? type families? palette intent?
Voice tone (knowledgeable peer / breezy / formal)?

### Standing decisions

The "the loop will never ask you about these" list. Sample:

- Pagination: none until N items.
- Sort: newest first.
- Empty-state copy template.
- Error-state styling.
- Top-N count for lists.
- Comments / login / payments — out of scope at every phase.

Add a row every time you find yourself answering the same
question twice during the build.

### Hard rules

Carry over from `../nexus/templates/AGENTS.md` Standing Rules. These
are universal:

1. Commit and push as a single atomic act.
2. No `Co-Authored-By:` trailers, no emojis.
3. Verify gate non-negotiable; deploy gate runs after every push.
4. No `--no-verify`, no force-push.
5. Tests alongside code.

Add project-specific ones (e.g. "site name lowercase", "content
stays in MDX").

Commit `bearings.md` separately. It's the most-read file in the
loop after the build plan.

---

## 3. Phases + build plan

Copy `../nexus/templates/plan/steps/01_build_plan.md` to your
repo's `plan/steps/01_build_plan.md`.

The "Status (at-a-glance)" block at the top is what the loop
reads. Each row is one phase. Phases group into:

- **Substrate** (1–4): bootstrap, content/data layer, URL
  contract scaffolding.
- **Page families / feature surfaces** (5–N): the bulk of the
  build.
- **Cross-cutting** (last few): polish, perf, a11y.

For your project, work backward from the spec:

1. List every distinct surface the v1 has (pages, screens,
   commands, endpoints).
2. Group them. Each group is one phase.
3. Add 4 substrate phases at the front (bootstrap, data,
   content, URL contract).
4. Add 2–3 cross-cutting phases at the end (search, polish,
   perf).
5. Aim for **10–20 phases total**. Less than 10 = phases too
   big. More than 20 = phases too small (combine).

For each phase, write a 1–2 line scope description in the
"Per-phase scope" section. That's enough for the loop to ship
the substrate phases. Phase 5 (the canonical sibling) gets a
detailed brief in step 5 of this playbook.

Commit the build plan.

---

## 4. Copy the rest of the templates

One sequence, three sub-steps, run in order: copy, then sweep
placeholders over what you just copied, then prune what your
project doesn't need. Running them out of order is the one
reliable way to leave stale tokens or dead files behind —
sweep before prune, prune after sweep, never the reverse.

### Copy

Run from your repo root. This is one `node` command (Node
≥18, already a prerequisite) so it runs identically in
bash/zsh, PowerShell, or `cmd.exe` — no shell twin needed:

```bash
node -e "const fs=require('fs');for(const [s,d] of [['templates/skills','skills'],['templates/claude','.claude'],['templates/claude/CLAUDE.md','CLAUDE.md'],['templates/scripts','scripts'],['templates/AGENTS.md','AGENTS.md'],['templates/env/env.example','.env.example'],['templates/plan/AUDIT.md','plan/AUDIT.md'],['templates/plan/CRITIQUE.md','plan/CRITIQUE.md'],['templates/plan/PHASE_CANDIDATES.md','plan/PHASE_CANDIDATES.md'],['templates/plan/README.md','plan/README.md'],['templates/plan/phases','plan/phases']]) fs.cpSync('../nexus/'+s,d,{recursive:true})"
```

(The `CLAUDE.md` line is deliberate, not redundant with the
`.claude` copy above it: Claude Code auto-loads `CLAUDE.md`
from the repo root, not from `.claude/`, so the pointer file
needs both copies to actually fire.)

(If using GitHub-as-DB, also copy `../nexus/templates/data/` to
`./data/`. See [`customization/data-layer.md`](../customization/data-layer.md)
to decide. If you copy it, add `./data` to the search-and-replace
scope below — both one-liners already include it, so nothing
else to change.)

### Replace placeholders

Now do a global search-and-replace across the copied files:

| Find | Replace with |
|---|---|
| `<PROJECT>` | your project name (e.g. `thock`) |
| `<PROJECT_LOWER>` | lowercase variant if different |
| `<PROJECT_TAGLINE>` | one-line description |
| `<HOSTING_URL>` | `https://your-site.netlify.app` |
| `<HOSTING_PROVIDER>` | `Netlify` / `Vercel` / etc. |
| `<REPO_SLUG>` | `your-org/your-repo` |
| `<DEFAULT_BRANCH>` | usually `main` |
| `<PROJECT_PKG_PREFIX>` | workspace package prefix, e.g. `@thock` (empty if not a monorepo) |

A one-liner that replaces all eight, bash/zsh/WSL/macOS.
Uses `-i.bak` (suffix attached, no space) rather than bare
`-i` — stock macOS `sed` is BSD sed, which requires a backup
suffix argument and otherwise misparses the following `-e` as
that argument and errors out; `-i.bak` is the one spelling
both BSD and GNU sed accept identically, so the trailing
`find` just cleans up the backups it forces:

```bash
grep -rl '<PROJECT>\|<PROJECT_LOWER>\|<PROJECT_TAGLINE>\|<HOSTING_URL>\|<HOSTING_PROVIDER>\|<REPO_SLUG>\|<DEFAULT_BRANCH>\|<PROJECT_PKG_PREFIX>' \
    ./skills ./.claude ./plan ./AGENTS.md ./scripts ./.env.example ./data \
  2>/dev/null | xargs sed -i.bak \
      -e 's/<PROJECT_LOWER>/thock/g' \
      -e 's/<PROJECT>/thock/g' \
      -e 's/<PROJECT_TAGLINE>/keyboards, deeply./g' \
      -e 's/<HOSTING_URL>/https:\/\/thock.xyz/g' \
      -e 's/<HOSTING_PROVIDER>/Netlify/g' \
      -e 's/<REPO_SLUG>/you\/thock/g' \
      -e 's/<DEFAULT_BRANCH>/main/g' \
      -e 's/<PROJECT_PKG_PREFIX>/@thock/g' \
  && find . -name '*.bak' -delete
```

The PowerShell twin, Windows native (see
[`windows-notes.md`](./windows-notes.md) for the hazards page
this pairs with):

```powershell
$repl = @{
  '<PROJECT>'             = 'thock'
  '<PROJECT_LOWER>'       = 'thock'
  '<PROJECT_TAGLINE>'     = 'keyboards, deeply.'
  '<HOSTING_URL>'         = 'https://thock.xyz'
  '<HOSTING_PROVIDER>'    = 'Netlify'
  '<REPO_SLUG>'           = 'you/thock'
  '<DEFAULT_BRANCH>'      = 'main'
  '<PROJECT_PKG_PREFIX>'  = '@thock'
}
Get-ChildItem -Recurse -File .\skills, .\.claude, .\plan, .\AGENTS.md, .\scripts, .\.env.example, .\data -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue |
  ForEach-Object {
    $text = Get-Content $_.FullName -Raw
    foreach ($k in $repl.Keys) { $text = $text -replace [regex]::Escape($k), $repl[$k] }
    Set-Content $_.FullName $text -NoNewline
  }
```

### Prune adopt-by-need files

The bulk copy above lands every skill unconditionally,
including ones only useful for capabilities you may not have
adopted. Cross-check against
[`templates/README.md`](../templates/README.md)'s "Adopt-by-need
files" table using the `Surface` / `Structured data` / `Auth` /
hermetic-e2e decisions you locked in step 2, plus whether UGC,
the cloud loop, and `/bootstrap` are in scope, and remove what
doesn't apply — leaving them present is misleading, per that
table:

- `skills/ship-data.md` + `.claude/commands/ship-data.md` —
  remove unless `Structured data` is `gh-as-db` /
  `hybrid-with-managed-postgres` / `pure-db` / `saas-cms`.
- `skills/ship-migration.md` + `.claude/commands/ship-migration.md`
  + `scripts/lint-migration.mjs` — remove unless
  `Structured data` is `pure-db` or `hybrid-with-managed-postgres`.
- `skills/ship-asset.md` + `.claude/commands/ship-asset.md` +
  `.claude/agents/brander.md` — remove unless `Surface` is
  `site` or `hybrid` AND branding is in scope.
- `skills/moderate.md` + `.claude/commands/moderate.md` —
  remove unless the project has UGC.
- `skills/digest.md` + `.claude/commands/digest.md` — remove
  unless the cloud loop is live and you want the daily
  morning-briefing genus (`.github/workflows/night.yml` +
  `heartbeat.yml` ship separately; step 4 never copies
  `.github/`, so only the skill + command file are at stake
  here).
- `skills/bootstrap.md` + `.claude/commands/bootstrap.md` +
  `scripts/bootstrap.mjs` — remove unless you plan to run
  `/bootstrap` as the setup executor.
- `scripts/refresh-critique-session.mjs` +
  `scripts/check-secrets-liveness.mjs` — remove unless
  `bearings.md`'s `Auth:` is anything other than `none`.
- `scripts/stack-lifecycle.mjs` — remove unless hermetic e2e
  uses Pattern B.
- `.claude/settings.json` + `.claude/hooks/guard.mjs` +
  `.claude/CLAUDE.md` + `scripts/notify.mjs` — remove unless
  you're running the loop on Claude Code and want unattended
  levels 3-4 (pre-approved permissions, hook-enforced hard
  rules, a pager). Root `CLAUDE.md` stays either way — Claude
  Code only auto-loads it from the repo root, not `.claude/`,
  and it doubles as plain project docs for any other agent.
- `scripts/install-hooks.mjs` — remove unless you want `pnpm
  verify` auto-armed as a pre-commit hook for hand commits made
  outside the loop.

Each command file opens with "Read `skills/<name>.md` end to
end before touching anything else" — leaving it behind after
removing its skill leaves a dead pointer, the same
presence-is-misleading problem as leaving the skill itself.

Example for a `Surface: service` project with `Structured data:
none`, no UGC, no cloud loop, no `/bootstrap`, `Auth: none`, no
hermetic e2e, not running the loop on Claude Code, and no
outside-the-loop pre-commit hook wanted — none of the ten apply,
so remove them all:

```bash
rm -f skills/ship-data.md skills/ship-migration.md scripts/lint-migration.mjs \
      skills/ship-asset.md .claude/agents/brander.md skills/moderate.md \
      skills/digest.md skills/bootstrap.md scripts/bootstrap.mjs \
      scripts/refresh-critique-session.mjs scripts/check-secrets-liveness.mjs \
      scripts/stack-lifecycle.mjs \
      .claude/settings.json .claude/hooks/guard.mjs .claude/CLAUDE.md \
      scripts/notify.mjs scripts/install-hooks.mjs \
      .claude/commands/ship-data.md .claude/commands/ship-migration.md \
      .claude/commands/ship-asset.md .claude/commands/moderate.md \
      .claude/commands/digest.md .claude/commands/bootstrap.md
```

```powershell
Remove-Item -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue skills\ship-data.md, skills\ship-migration.md, `
  scripts\lint-migration.mjs, skills\ship-asset.md, .claude\agents\brander.md, skills\moderate.md, `
  skills\digest.md, skills\bootstrap.md, scripts\bootstrap.mjs, `
  scripts\refresh-critique-session.mjs, scripts\check-secrets-liveness.mjs, `
  scripts\stack-lifecycle.mjs, `
  .claude\settings.json, .claude\hooks\guard.mjs, .claude\CLAUDE.md, `
  scripts\notify.mjs, scripts\install-hooks.mjs, `
  .claude\commands\ship-data.md, .claude\commands\ship-migration.md, `
  .claude\commands\ship-asset.md, .claude\commands\moderate.md, `
  .claude\commands\digest.md, .claude\commands\bootstrap.md
```

Commit the templates as a single commit: `chore: nexus
templates copied`.

(nexus checks this walkthrough mechanically, on itself, with
`node scripts/adopt-dryrun.mjs` — see `skills/critique.md`.)

---

## 5. Phase 1 brief

`plan/phases/phase_1_bootstrap.md` is the first thing the loop
ships. It needs to be **detailed**.

Step 4's bulk copy already landed
`plan/phases/phase_1_bootstrap.md` and
`plan/phases/phase_canonical_sibling.md` locally, placeholders
already swept (both sit under `./plan`, in the sweep's scope).
Edit `plan/phases/phase_1_bootstrap.md` in place to match your
stack:

- **Outputs section:** list every file phase 1 should produce.
  For a Next.js project: `package.json`, `next.config.mjs`,
  `tailwind.config.ts`, `apps/web/src/app/layout.tsx`,
  `apps/web/src/app/page.tsx`, etc.
- **Stack pins:** specific package versions.
- **Tokens / theme:** if you have design tokens, paste them.
- **Tests:** what unit + e2e the phase ships.
- **Decisions made upfront:** every "the loop will not ask"
  decision, written here.

The bar for this brief is: **a competent agent could ship it
without asking you a question**. If you find yourself thinking
"the agent will figure that out" — write it down instead.

Same for `plan/phases/phase_canonical_sibling.md` — rename it
to match your phase number (usually phase 4 or 5) as you edit
it. This is the **template** every later page-family /
feature-surface phase mirrors. Time spent here amortizes across
the whole build.

Commit both briefs.

---

## 6. Wire the verify gate

The verify gate is `pnpm verify` (or your equivalent). It runs
**before every commit** and gates the push.

No `package.json` exists yet at this point in the walk — phase
1 (the brief you just wrote in step 5) is what scaffolds one.
This section describes the **target shape** for that brief to
produce, not something to run against an empty repo right now:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "typecheck": "tsc --noEmit",
    "test:run": "vitest run",
    "build": "your-build-cmd",
    "e2e": "playwright test",
    "verify": "pnpm typecheck && pnpm test:run && pnpm build && pnpm e2e"
  }
}
```

Once phase 1 has scaffolded the file, test it:

```bash
pnpm verify
```

It will fail at first — that's fine; the rest of phase 1 is
what makes it green. But the script itself should be in place
and runnable as soon as phase 1 lands.

If your project doesn't ship a build (e.g., a CLI), drop
`pnpm build`. If no e2e yet, drop `pnpm e2e` until phase 4
adds the harness. The gate is **what's actually runnable
today**; it grows with the project.

See [`customization/verify-gate.md`](../customization/verify-gate.md)
for stack-specific compositions.

---

## 7. Wire the deploy gate

The deploy gate is `pnpm deploy:check`. It runs **after every
push** and polls your hosting provider until ready or error.

`./scripts/deploy-check.mjs` is already present — step 4's
bulk copy landed it with the rest of `scripts/`. Wire it into
`package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "deploy:check": "node scripts/deploy-check.mjs"
  }
}
```

Choose your provider per
[`ci-providers.md`](./ci-providers.md) and set `DEPLOY_PROVIDER`
in your local `.env` (defaults to `netlify`), plus that
provider's auth env var (e.g. `NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN`).

Test it:

```bash
pnpm deploy:check
```

It should report the current deploy state. If you haven't pushed
anything yet, it'll say "no deploy for this commit" — that's
fine; the contract is post-push.

Commit `package.json` + `scripts/deploy-check.mjs` + `.env.example`.

**Do not commit `.env`.** Confirm `.env` is in `.gitignore`.

---

## 8. Sub-agents

Most projects need 2–4 specialist sub-agents. Decide which apply:

- **`scout`** — open-web research. Almost every project needs
  this. Already present from step 4's bulk copy
  (`.claude/agents/scout.md`) — review and adapt.
- **`reader`** — fresh-eyes site observer (used by `/critique`).
  If your project produces a website. Already present from
  step 4 (`.claude/agents/reader.md`) — review and adapt.
- **One or two domain specialists** — your project's "what does
  the agent need to be expert at?" If editorial: a copy editor.
  If data-heavy: a schema steward. If API: an OpenAPI checker.
  See [`customization/sub-agents.md`](../customization/sub-agents.md)
  for the design pattern.

Each sub-agent goes in `.claude/agents/<name>.md` with the
correct frontmatter (name, description, tools).

---

## 9. (Optional) Run `/bootstrap` to provision external services

If your project depends on a hosted database, hosting
provider, auth provider, or other external services, you
have two paths to wire them:

- **Manual.** Walk each `setup/NN_<service>.md` runbook
  yourself. Best when you want maximal control or you're
  using providers without a stable CLI / API.
- **Automated.** Run `/bootstrap` (see
  [`../customization/bootstrap-automation.md`](../customization/bootstrap-automation.md)).
  Takes tokens in, drives provider CLIs out, ends with a
  green deploy + a ticking cloud loop. Handoffs (DNS,
  OAuth approvals, App installs) pause for the user;
  everything else is scripted.

For the automated path, `./setup` doesn't exist yet — step
4's bulk copy never lands `templates/setup/` — so create it
before copying the manifest in:

```bash
mkdir -p setup
cp ../nexus/templates/setup/bootstrap.example.json \
  setup/bootstrap.local.json
```

The PowerShell twin, Windows native:

```powershell
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force setup | Out-Null
Copy-Item ..\nexus\templates\setup\bootstrap.example.json `
  setup\bootstrap.local.json
```

Fill in your project settings, then run `/bootstrap status`
(read-only) to preview the plan, then `/bootstrap` for the
interactive walk.

The manifest ships with the same `<PROJECT>` /
`<PROJECT_LOWER>` tokens step 4's placeholder table covers,
but step 4's sed ran before `./setup` existed, so it never
touched this file. Sweep it the same way before running
`/bootstrap`:

```bash
sed -i -e 's/<PROJECT_LOWER>/thock/g' -e 's/<PROJECT>/thock/g' \
  setup/bootstrap.local.json
```

The PowerShell twin:

```powershell
(Get-Content setup\bootstrap.local.json -Raw) `
  -replace '<PROJECT_LOWER>', 'thock' -replace '<PROJECT>', 'thock' |
  Set-Content setup\bootstrap.local.json -NoNewline
```

The bootstrap layer is opt-in and standalone — skipping it
doesn't break anything; the rest of nexus works the same.

## 10. Smoke test

Run:

```
/ship-a-phase
```

(In Claude Code. Or read `skills/ship-a-phase.md` and follow
the procedure manually if using a different tool.)

Expected:

1. Reads the build plan, picks phase 1 (the first `[ ]`).
2. Reads phase 1's brief.
3. Builds the substrate per the brief.
4. Runs `pnpm verify` — fails the first time, iterates.
5. Commits.
6. Pushes.
7. Runs `pnpm deploy:check` — may be red the first time
   (Netlify rebuilds the workspace; expected if the previous
   state was a stub).
8. Reports done.

If any step misbehaves: stop, read the relevant skill file
section, fix the brief or the gate, retry. **Don't soldier on
through a wonky phase 1.** It poisons every later phase.

---

## 11. Ratchet up the autonomy

Once phase 1 ships green:

- Run `/ship-a-phase` manually for phases 2–4. Watch the agent
  work.
- At phase 5 (the canonical sibling), spend extra care — every
  later page family copies its structure.
- After phase 5: `/loop /march` for an evening session. Watch
  it ship 2–3 phases. Intervene with `/oversight` if needed.
- Once you trust 3 unattended phases in a row: walk away for an
  afternoon.
- Once you trust an afternoon: read [`intervention-spectrum.md`](../intervention-spectrum.md)
  for the 80-hour beast pattern.

The progression is days, not minutes. Don't skip levels.

---

## Common pitfalls

- **Build plan too shallow.** Phases 1–4 ship fast; phases 5+
  ship slowly. If your plan is only 6 phases, you'll run out
  of work in 2 days. Aim for 12–17.
- **Bearings vague.** If `bearings.md` doesn't enumerate
  standing decisions, the loop will ask you (= stop) on every
  ambiguity. Add to bearings every time you catch yourself
  re-deciding.
- **No canonical sibling.** Phase 5 is the template every later
  page-family phase mirrors. If you skip the brief detail
  there, every later phase has to re-derive structure. 1 hour
  in phase 5 saves 4 hours across phases 6–13.
- **Deploy gate ignored.** "I'll add it later." No. Wire it on
  day one even if it's red until phase 1. The gate's first job
  is keeping the loop honest.
- **No `/oversight` checkpoint.** You'll need it. Set a
  reminder to run it every 12 hours during unattended runs.

---

## You're ready when (the Day 1 checklist)

This is the "you're about to invoke `/ship-a-phase` for the
first time on a fresh adoption — here's what should be true"
checklist. Distinct from the Level-4 pre-flight (see
[`../intervention-spectrum.md`](../intervention-spectrum.md)),
which assumes a working loop and is about leaving for 80 hours.

- [ ] `spec.md` is one page or more, scope is clear, persona
      named.
- [ ] `plan/bearings.md` locks stack + URL contract + standing
      decisions + the `Surface:` line. If your project has
      user accounts, also: identity tiers, anti-abuse posture,
      moderation flow (see the optional sections in the
      bearings template).
- [ ] `plan/bearings.md` has an entry for `Auth provider` (or
      "none, v1"). If `Auth provider` is pinned, the matching
      `setup/NN_<auth>.md` runbook exists (even as a STUB).
- [ ] If your project depends on external services beyond
      hosting, `setup/00_files.md` index exists with one row
      per service. See
      [`../customization/external-services.md`](../customization/external-services.md).
- [ ] `plan/steps/01_build_plan.md` has 10–20 phases.
- [ ] Phase 1 brief is detailed enough to ship without asking.
- [ ] Canonical sibling brief (usually phase 4 or 5) is detailed.
- [ ] At least one design artifact (visual system, design
      tokens, or a `claude-design.prompt.md` for commissioning
      one) is either committed or has a written brief. See
      [`../customization/visual-system.md`](../customization/visual-system.md).
- [ ] `pnpm verify` runs (may fail; runs).
- [ ] `pnpm deploy:check` runs and reads your provider's state.
- [ ] `.env` has all secrets. `.env.example` documents every
      key, with a comment pointing back to the `setup/`
      runbook section that emits it.
- [ ] Sub-agents are in `.claude/agents/` and tested.
- [ ] You've read `skills/ship-a-phase.md` end to end.
- [ ] **Optional, pick up once the loop's been running a
      while:** once the project accumulates real recurring
      lessons (not day-1 setup), copy
      `plan/reflexes.md` + `plan/lessons.md` in per
      [`../customization/lessons-layer.md`](../customization/lessons-layer.md) —
      a scratch `NEXUS_LESSONS.md` doesn't scale past a
      handful of entries.
- [ ] **Optional but high-leverage:** if during this adoption
      you noticed nexus gaps (places where the playbook left
      you to figure something out yourself, or templates you
      wished existed), write a `NEXUS_LESSONS.md` in your
      project root. A separate Claude session can run
      `/lessons-pr <project-path>` against the nexus repo
      later (see
      [`../skills/lessons-pr.md`](../skills/lessons-pr.md)).
      The methodology improves with every honest application.

When all checks pass: invoke `/ship-a-phase` for the first
time.
