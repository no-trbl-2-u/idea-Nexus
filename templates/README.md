# Templates

Copy these into your target repo per the playbook
(`../playbooks/new-project.md` or
`../playbooks/existing-project.md`).

## Placeholders

After copying, search-and-replace across the new files:

| Placeholder | Replace with | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `<PROJECT>` | Your product name | `thock` |
| `<PROJECT_LOWER>` | Lowercase variant | `thock` |
| `<PROJECT_TAGLINE>` | One-line description | `keyboards, deeply.` |
| `<HOSTING_URL>` | Live site URL | `https://thock.xyz` |
| `<HOSTING_PROVIDER>` | Hosting provider | `Netlify` |
| `<REPO_SLUG>` | GitHub repo slug | `daretodave/thock` |
| `<DEFAULT_BRANCH>` | Default branch | `main` |
| `<PROJECT_PKG_PREFIX>` | Workspace package prefix | `@thock` (or empty if not a monorepo) |

For the full bash and PowerShell one-liners that replace all
eight in one pass, see
[`playbooks/new-project.md`](../playbooks/new-project.md) §4 —
copy-paste from there rather than hand-rolling a partial
version here.

## Don't copy these as-is

A few files in templates intentionally have project-specific
shape that you must fill in:

- `plan/bearings.md` — needs your stack, URL contract, voice,
  and the `Surface:` declaration (gates the optional branding
  capability).
- `plan/steps/01_build_plan.md` — needs your phases (ours
  describes a generic content-site shape; replace)
- `plan/phases/phase_1_bootstrap.md` — needs your stack's
  bootstrap (Next.js, Django, Rails, etc.)
- `plan/phases/phase_canonical_sibling.md` — needs your project's
  first non-substrate page-family / feature-surface

For these, the templates are **scaffolds** showing the shape;
adapt content to your reality.

## Adopt-by-need files

A few files are part of the standard kit but only useful for
projects that actually need them. Copy them only when adopting
the corresponding capability:

| File | Adopt when |
|---|---|
| `skills/ship-data.md` + `claude/commands/ship-data.md` | The project has a structured data layer (`gh-as-db`, `hybrid-with-managed-postgres`, `pure-db`, `saas-cms`). See `nexus/customization/data-layer.md`. |
| `skills/ship-migration.md` + `claude/commands/ship-migration.md` + `scripts/lint-migration.mjs` | `Structured data` is `pure-db` or `hybrid-with-managed-postgres` — the project has a managed-Postgres (or compatible) DB. See `nexus/customization/data-layer.md` Patterns B and D. |
| `skills/ship-asset.md` + `claude/commands/ship-asset.md` + `claude/agents/brander.md` | `Surface: site` or `hybrid` AND you want the loop to render brand assets (OG images, favicons, social cards, SVG → PNG, wordmarks). Demand-pull only — drains findings filed by `/critique`, `/iterate`, or an `/oversight` brand pass. See `nexus/customization/branding.md`. |
| `skills/moderate.md` + `claude/commands/moderate.md` | The project has UGC (comments, submissions, votes, flags) and needs a dedicated queue-drain skill (Option A). See `nexus/customization/moderation-loop.md`. |
| `plan/CURRENT-STATE.md` | This is a brownfield retrofit, not a greenfield start. See `nexus/playbooks/existing-project.md` §1. |
| `setup/00_files.md` + `setup/NN_service.md` | The project depends on any external service beyond hosting (auth provider, managed DB, email service, AI API). See `nexus/customization/external-services.md`. |
| `claude/settings.json` + `claude/hooks/guard.mjs` + `claude/CLAUDE.md` + `scripts/notify.mjs` | You run the loop on Claude Code and want unattended levels (3–4): pre-approved permissions, hook-enforced hard rules, and a pager. See `nexus/customization/claude-code.md` + `nexus/playbooks/hands-off.md`. |
| `scripts/refresh-critique-session.mjs` + `scripts/check-secrets-liveness.mjs` | `bearings.md`'s `Auth:` is anything other than `none` — Pattern B session refresh + the GH_TOKEN/`CRITIQUE_*` liveness probe for hands-off pre-flight. See `nexus/customization/auth-aware-critique.md`. |
| `skills/digest.md` + `claude/commands/digest.md` + `.github/workflows/night.yml` + `.github/workflows/heartbeat.yml` | The cloud loop is live and you want the rest of the genus: a daily morning briefing (`plan/DIGEST.md`), nightly breadth checks, and a model-free watchdog. See `nexus/concepts/loop-shapes.md`. |
| `skills/bootstrap.md` + `claude/commands/bootstrap.md` + `scripts/bootstrap.mjs` | You plan to run `/bootstrap` as the setup executor (tokens-in to deployed app + ticking cloud loop). See `nexus/customization/bootstrap-automation.md`. |
| `.github/workflows/nightly-smoke.yml` | Hermetic e2e is adopted and `night.yml` doesn't already run `SMOKE_SAMPLE=full` as its breadth step — run one or the other, never both. See `nexus/customization/hermetic-e2e.md` + `nexus/concepts/loop-shapes.md`. |
| `workspace/CLAUDE.md` + `workspace/AGENTS.md` + `workspace/README.md` + `workspace/REPOS.md` | You've outgrown polyrepo into a 3+-repo workspace (an un-versioned local root holding `plan/` and every product as siblings). Copy all four to the workspace root, not into any single repo. See `nexus/playbooks/workspace.md`. |
| `scripts/stack-lifecycle.mjs` | Hermetic e2e uses Pattern B (service with stateful dependencies). See `nexus/customization/hermetic-e2e.md`. |
| `design-prompt.md` (copy to `<repo>/claude-design.prompt.md`) | The project has a deliberate visual identity worth a system layer (not just assets). See `nexus/customization/visual-system.md`. |
| `scripts/install-hooks.mjs` | You want `pnpm verify` to run automatically on hand commits made outside the loop. Opt-in — run it once (`node scripts/install-hooks.mjs`) to arm a `.git/hooks/pre-commit`; `--uninstall` removes it. See `nexus/customization/verify-gate.md`. |
| `plan/reflexes.md` + `plan/lessons.md` | The loop has run long enough to accumulate real recurring lessons and a single `NEXUS_LESSONS.md` scratch file no longer scales. See `nexus/customization/lessons-layer.md`. |

If your `bearings.md` declares `Surface: service / library /
cli`, do not copy `ship-asset.md` / `brander.md` — the skill
would no-op anyway and the presence is misleading.

Branding does not get its own `AskUserQuestion`-allowed
skill. When the project needs taste calls (mood, accent,
wordmark treatment), the user runs `/oversight` — that's
already the user-in-the-loop exception (`/bootstrap` carries
the only other one, for provisioning), and it's plenty.

## Reference implementations

Two real projects you can copy from instead of (or alongside)
these templates:

- **thock** (editorial content site, monorepo, Next.js +
  MDX-in-repo + JSON-as-DB) — `https://github.com/daretodave/thock`
- **tickpedia** (data-heavy site with weekly automation) — see
  the project's own repo if accessible.

If you're building something close to one of these shapes, copy
that project's `skills/`, `plan/`, `.claude/` and adapt names —
faster than starting from these templates.
