# The cloud loop (nexus on nexus)

> Operator's guide for `workflows/march.yml` — the ouroboros.
> The kit that turns repos into self-shipping projects is
> itself a self-shipping project: four times a day, a cloud
> tick reads `plan/`, dispatches one verb, runs the verify
> gate, and pushes. This file is the 2-minute operator manual;

## Setup (one app install + two secrets)

1. **Install the Claude Code GitHub App** on this repo:
   https://github.com/apps/claude → Install → select
   `daretodave/nexus`. The action exchanges its OIDC token for
   an app token; without the app the run dies at
   `401 — Claude Code is not installed on this repository`
   before Anthropic auth ever runs. (The kit knew this — see
   the template's setup step 1 and the bootstrap handoff; this
   manual learned it from crash issue #1.)
2. `claude setup-token` → copy the OAuth token → Repo →
   Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → new secret
   `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`.
3. `ACTIONS_PAT` — a fine-grained PAT (Contents + Issues +
   Workflows: read/write on this repo). Workflows was added
   2026-08-23 so cloud ticks can ship `.github/workflows/`
   edits themselves; grant nothing beyond these three — this
   token is what a prompt-injected tick runs with, so no
   Secrets/Webhooks/Variables. This repo runs **user-author
   mode**: cloud commits author as `nexus` (the PAT account's
   noreply email), never `github-actions[bot]`. Identity rides
   `GIT_AUTHOR_*` / `GIT_COMMITTER_*` env vars on the action
   step — NOT `git config`, which the action's own internal
   config step silently overrides.
4. Validate once by hand: `gh workflow run march`, watch the
   run end green, read the closing `/oversight audit` block.

That's all. The kit's gate needs no other secrets (zero
dependencies, no deploy provider). If `ACTIONS_PAT` expires or
is removed, checkout fails red on the next tick — re-mint and
re-set, nothing else to repair.

## Daily operation

- **Cadence:** 02:00 / 08:00 / 14:00 / 20:00 UTC, plus manual
  `gh workflow run march` whenever curious.
- **Ceiling:** 8 weighted points per 24h, counted by the
  `Cloud-Run:` trailer. The count is weighted, not flat: a
  phase-shipping commit (one that ticks a `[ ]` to `[x]` in
  `plan/steps/01_build_plan.md`) costs 3, a churn commit
  (`/iterate`, `/critique`, `/triage`, `/digest`) costs 1.
  Local commits don't count.
- **Model:** `claude-sonnet-5` (set in the workflow; ids age —
  verify against current ids before changing).
- **Pause / resume:** `gh workflow disable march` /
  `gh workflow enable march`. Do this before driving the local
  loop for a session (one writer at a time).
- **Remote steering:** file an issue — that's remote `/jot`;
  the next tick's `/triage` routes it with user-source weight.

## What a tick does

`skills/march.md` dispatch: unlabeled issues → `/triage`;
critique due → `/critique` (the dry-run adoption — it runs
fully in CI); pending phase → `/ship-a-phase`; expand due →
`/expand`; else `/iterate`. Every shipping path runs
`node scripts/verify.mjs` foreground and ends with an
`/oversight audit` briefing in the run log.

## The trailer carve-out

`AGENTS.md` rule 2 (plain commit bodies) has exactly one
exception: cloud commits end with
`Cloud-Run: <run-url>`. It's how the ceiling distinguishes
cloud volume from local work. Nothing else — no
`Co-Authored-By`, no other trailers.

## When something breaks

- **`401 — Claude Code is not installed on this repository`**
  in the app-token exchange — the GitHub App isn't installed
  (setup step 1). Install it, `gh run rerun`, done.
- **Green run, no commit, transcript full of `This command
  requires approval`** — the permission wall: the action ran
  without `permissionMode: bypassPermissions` (or a workflow
  edit dropped it) and starved. See the `claude_args` comment
  in `workflows/march.yml` and
  [`customization/claude-code.md`](../customization/claude-code.md)
  for why bypass-on-a-disposable-runner is the sanctioned
  posture (guard hooks enforce the hard rules in every mode).
- **`Cloud march tick crashed` issue appears** — read the run
  link. One-off infra flake → `gh run rerun`. Repeated →
  disable and debug locally per
  [`playbooks/recovery.md`](../playbooks/recovery.md) §H.
- **A run wedges `in_progress`** — cancel it; if the log
  stalls right after a green gate, that's the post-result exit
  hang: the gate was backgrounded, which AGENTS.md rule 3
  forbids. Full story in
  [`playbooks/cloud-loop.md`](../playbooks/cloud-loop.md).
- **Ticks no-op forever** — the plan may be out of `[ ]` rows
  and the queues drained (a good problem: run `/oversight`
  locally and promote candidates), or GitHub paused the cron
  after 60 days without repo activity (push anything or re-run
  manually to revive).

## The other shapes

The dispatcher is one of three loops on this repo (the full
genus: [`concepts/loop-shapes.md`](../concepts/loop-shapes.md)):

- **`night.yml` — the night shift.** Daily at 10:30 UTC, one
  `/digest` tick writes
  [`plan/DIGEST.md`](../plan/DIGEST.md) — the morning
  briefing: what shipped (including no-op ticks), queues,
  what needs you, today's intent, and any gate-tuning
  proposals (filed as candidates, never applied). Read it
  with coffee instead of reading run logs.
- **`heartbeat.yml` — the immune system.** Every 6h, no
  model: cancels runs wedged past 2h (unblocking the shared
  concurrency group) and opens a deduped issue if march
  hasn't completed a tick in 14h. It never writes to the
  repo; it only tells on the others.
- **The concierge lane.** Two remote controls: label any
  issue `loop:do` and the next tick triages it straight to
  the top with a priority bump; or run a specific verb from
  anywhere — `gh workflow run march -f verb=critique`.

All writers share one concurrency group; the heartbeat is the
only loop allowed to run beside them.

## Reviewing the loop's work

The commit log is the deliverable. Cloud commits carry the
run-URL trailer; each phase has a mirror issue that opened
when work started and closed on the shipping commit. The
`/oversight audit` block at the end of every run log is the
instrument panel — queues, blocked rows, flags — skimmable
from a phone.
