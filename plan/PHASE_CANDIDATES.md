## Pending

### [ ] [score 7.8] Workflow-scope-blocked lane: stop re-discovering the App-token-overrides-PAT gap per phase
- proposed: 2026-08-31
- source signals: three independent AUDIT rows share one root
  cause — phase 20 (`[user-issue #35]`, 2026-08-23), the
  phase-23 patch nexus's own march.yml/night.yml still needs
  applied by hand (`[user-issue #40]`), and phase 32
  (`[user-issue #49]`, 2026-08-30) all built and verified clean
  in a cloud tick, then had `git push` rejected on
  `.github/workflows/*.yml` with "refusing to allow a GitHub
  App to create or update workflow ... without `workflows`
  permission" — even though the checkout step and the `Run
  /march` step both pass `secrets.ACTIONS_PAT`. Each occurrence
  discovered the same fact fresh: the push that actually
  authenticates is the Claude Code Action's own GitHub App
  installation token (`gh auth status` mid-tick shows
  `claude[bot]` via a `ghs_...` token, not the PAT), not
  `ACTIONS_PAT` — isolated because non-workflow-file pushes in
  the very same runs succeed. `[user-issue #35]`'s own `next`
  field already names the two live hypotheses (Action overwrites
  the checkout-configured git credential before the agent's turn
  starts, or `ACTIONS_PAT` doesn't actually carry `workflows`
  scope despite the re-mint) but no tick has been able to test
  either, since every cloud tick reproduces the identical
  credential wiring.
- rationale: this has cost three built-and-discarded cloud
  ticks (each ran the phase to completion, verified green, then
  threw the diff away per AGENTS.md rule 1) and will keep
  costing one per future phase that touches
  `.github/workflows/*.yml` — for nexus and for any adopter who
  copies the cloud-loop template and later edits their own
  `march.yml`/`heartbeat.yml`. A one-time fix (or a formalized
  routing convention) is cheaper than the recurring waste.
- proposed scope: a local/human session (normal repo-write
  creds, not the Action's App token) tests whether an explicit
  `git remote set-url origin
  https://x-access-token:${ACTIONS_PAT}@github.com/<org>/<repo>.git`
  (or `http.extraheader`) immediately before the push step
  forces the PAT's credential over the Action's, resolving
  hypothesis (a); separately confirms `ACTIONS_PAT`'s actual
  scope grants in GitHub's token settings UI (hypothesis (b)).
  If (a) fixes it: land the explicit remote-credential step in
  `.github/workflows/march.yml` + `templates/.github/workflows/march.yml`
  (and `heartbeat.yml` if it ever pushes). If neither
  hypothesis yields a fix: formalize the fallback that's
  already happening ad hoc — `.github/CLOUD_LOOP.md` gets a
  "workflow-touching phases" note (build + verify still run in
  the cloud tick, but the push is skipped in favor of a single
  dedicated issue for `/oversight` to apply), and
  `skills/ship-a-phase.md` checks the diff for
  `.github/workflows/*.yml` before attempting the push so a
  future tick fails fast instead of discovering the rejection
  after a full build.
- estimated phases: 1
- conflicts: none — orthogonal to other pending candidates;
  closes `[user-issue #35]`, `[user-issue #40]`, and
  `[user-issue #49]` together if the fix lands, or gives all
  three a documented standing resolution path if it doesn't.

### [promoted 2026-08-23 → phase 22] [score 8.8] Workspace-of-repos as a first-class adoption path
- proposed: 2026-07-03
- source signals: kintilla AND semilayer independently converged
  on the same topology — un-versioned workspace root,
  org-per-project GitHub layout, `plan/` its own repo, sibling
  product repos — which the kit only half-documents
  (`playbooks/polyrepo.md` covers the plan split alone).
- rationale: two real adoptions converging unprompted is the
  strongest possible signal; every workspace adopter currently
  re-improvises the root conventions.
- proposed scope: `playbooks/workspace.md` (un-versioned-root
  rule, org-per-project, what lives only at root, decision
  matrix, ready-when checklist); `templates/workspace/` root
  family (workspace CLAUDE.md + AGENTS.md mirror, scratch
  README, repo-claude propagation template); a
  topology-detection step in the adopt prompt with a
  confirm-with-user stop; edits to `playbooks/polyrepo.md` +
  `concepts/architecture.md` so single-repo -> polyrepo ->
  workspace reads as one ladder.
- estimated phases: 1-2
- conflicts: extends polyrepo.md, never replaces it.

### [promoted 2026-08-23 → phase 21] [score 8.6] prompts/ as canonical files + a five-line paste
- proposed: 2026-07-03
- source signals: the two ~60-line README paste-prompts are the
  funnel's biggest wall; prompt fixes today mean "re-paste the
  new blob".
- rationale: `prompts/adopt.md` + `prompts/pitch.md` as
  versioned, gate-linted files turn the paste into five lines
  that self-clone (or one raw.githubusercontent fetch line),
  client-agnostic by construction; every other doorway (npx,
  plugin) later references the same canonical text.
- proposed scope: `prompts/adopt.md`, `prompts/pitch.md`,
  `prompts/README.md`; README TL;DR sections shrink ~120
  lines; a verify leg keeping any README excerpt byte-synced
  with prompts/; `skills/critique.md` dry-runs the new short
  paste; AGENTS.md notes prompts/ paths are public API.
- estimated phases: 1
- conflicts: pairs with the README conversion pass below —
  promote together or sequence prompts/ first.

### [ ] [score 8.5] Two-ring secrets topology (.env vs .env.workspace)
- proposed: 2026-07-03
- source signals: both mature adoptions run the same secrets
  layering the kit says nothing about — per-repo `.env` for the
  loop's own gate tokens, workspace-root `.env.workspace` for
  cross-repo operational secrets, `.secrets/` for key FILES.
- rationale: the safety property is structural, not procedural —
  the workspace root is outside every repo, so `git add -A`
  physically cannot leak Ring 2. Answers the scariest adopter
  question ("where do secrets go?") with architecture.
- proposed scope: `customization/workspace-secrets.md` (two
  rings + key-file pointer rule + placement tiebreaker: consumed
  by, or granting power over, more than one repo -> Ring 2);
  `templates/env/env.workspace.example` (names never values;
  per-key grammar: minted-by runbook, mirrored-to, expires);
  header pointer in `templates/env/env.example`; see-also links
  in polyrepo.md + external-services.md.
- estimated phases: 1
- conflicts: none — opens with "skip unless polyrepo/workspace".

### [ ] [score 8.3] README above-the-fold conversion pass
- proposed: 2026-07-03
- source signals: conversion happens in the first screenful;
  today the pitch is stated twice, the paste is 60 lines, and
  the workspace shape has no front door. Full restructure
  outline captured 2026-07-03 (ideation session).
- rationale: hook -> proof -> qualify -> convert -> deepen ->
  trust -> rules; target ~350 lines from ~690. The march.yml
  badge whose green is produced by the loop it sells is proof
  no competitor can hand-copy.
- proposed scope: README-only editing session: kill the
  blockquote echo, merge the three qualification sections into
  one gate above the doors, collapse the two TL;DRs + mermaid
  into a three-door section, replace eight playbook blurbs with
  a router table (you have -> do this -> time), ouroboros proof
  strip up top, date-stamped adoption-receipt diffstat in a
  details block. Repoint the verify tree leg in the same commit.
- estimated phases: 1
- conflicts: depends on prompts/ landing first (the doors paste
  five lines, not sixty).

### [ ] [score 8.2] Versioned releases + plan/nexus.lock + upgrade story
- proposed: 2026-07-03
- source signals: adopters copy from a moving main and can never
  diff what changed; every packaging doorway needs something
  stable to pin against.
- rationale: "copy once, drift forever" becomes "pin, then
  upgrade deliberately" — dependency semantics with nothing but
  git tags and one JSON lock (kitVersion, kitCommit, per-file
  hashAtCopy). Three-way merge separates "stale, cleanly
  bumped" from "customized, needs eyes".
- proposed scope: KIT_VERSION + CHANGELOG.md keyed by template
  path; `scripts/kit-manifest.mjs` (hermetic sha256 walk);
  lock-writing step in prompts/adopt.md; `playbooks/upgrade.md`
  (git merge-file three-way; [needs-user-call] AUDIT rows for
  conflicted files; pre-lock fallback via re-hash against
  historical tags); verify legs for version/CHANGELOG sync.
- estimated phases: 2
- conflicts: prompts/ should land first (the lock step lives
  there); permanent CHANGELOG discipline cost — worth it.

### [ ] [score 7.9] Handshake runbook profile for setup/
- proposed: 2026-07-03
- source signals: kintilla's runbooks follow a proven handshake
  the kit's setup/ paradigm doesn't capture: "human dashboard
  steps (~N min) -> drop these exact keys into the env file ->
  say 'X is in' -> what the agent wires after the drop".
- rationale: turns every external service into a
  fill-in-the-blanks credential handoff; keys arrive in files,
  not chat. The "THE STEP THAT CAN BREAK <X>" destructive-step
  callout convention rides along.
- proposed scope: `templates/setup/NN_service.handshake.md`
  (four fixed sections; fenced env-block naming exact keys +
  exact target file + resume signal); "two runbook profiles"
  chooser in external-services.md (agent can do >80% via CLI
  once it has a token -> handshake); profile column in
  00_files.md legend.
- estimated phases: 1
- conflicts: none — second layer of the two-ring secrets story.

### [promoted 2026-08-23 → phase 19] [score 9.0] Rewrite playbooks/new-project.md's step-4 copy-and-placeholder walkthrough as one verified sequence
- proposed: 2026-07-06; re-evidenced 2026-07-10, 2026-07-13,
  2026-07-21, 2026-07-23 (x2), 2026-07-24, 2026-07-26
- source signals: this is the second critique cycle in a row to
  land findings in the same step-4/7 block of
  playbooks/new-project.md. The four findings that originally
  motivated this candidate (sibling-clone copy paths,
  `PHASE_CANDIDATES.md` never copied, CLAUDE.md never landed at
  root, and their combined ordering) are now all fixed
  individually (see `plan/CRITIQUE.md` Done log) — and critique
  pass 3 (2026-07-10) immediately found six more in the identical
  region: `templates/plan/phases/` also never lands in step 4's
  copy array despite step 5 depending on it (HIGH — literal
  placeholder tokens ship in phase 1's brief); the placeholder
  grep scope still misses `./scripts` and `./.env.example` (MED,
  confirmed unresolved `<PROJECT_LOWER>`/`<REPO_SLUG>` tokens);
  the blanket `skills/` copy still contradicts the adopt-by-need
  contract (MED); step 7 redundantly re-copies
  `deploy-check.mjs` already placed by step 4's bulk copy (LOW);
  step 6 edits a `package.json` that doesn't exist at that point
  in the walk (LOW); the pnpm sed caveat has no worked example
  (MED, see the sibling candidate below). Critique pass 4
  (2026-07-13) sharpened the adopt-by-need prune finding still
  further: the "Prune adopt-by-need files" fix only gives worked
  removal steps for 4 of `templates/README.md`'s ~12 adopt-by-need
  rows, leaving `skills/digest.md`, `skills/bootstrap.md`,
  `scripts/refresh-critique-session.mjs`,
  `scripts/check-secrets-liveness.mjs`, and
  `scripts/stack-lifecycle.mjs` unconditionally landed with no
  prompt to remove them for adopters who don't need them —
  confirmed in a scratch repro. Third cycle in a row landing in
  this same block. A fresh A-G AUDIT sweep (2026-07-21, not a
  critique pass) found a fourth instance of the identical
  grep-scope bug: the same one-liners also omit `./data`, so
  `templates/data/README.md`'s `<PROJECT>`/`<PROJECT_PKG_PREFIX>`
  tokens survive the sweep unresolved for GitHub-as-DB adopters —
  fixed same-commit (`ced0304`), the third distinct scope gap
  found this way after `./scripts` and `./.env.example`. The bug
  class now reproduces from both signal A (audit) and signal B
  (critique), always in the same one-liners. Since pass 4
  (2026-07-22), four more instances landed in the identical
  block, two per sub-mechanism the proposed scope already names:
  the placeholder one-liner broke again twice more — bare
  `sed -i` misparsed by stock macOS/BSD sed (2026-07-23, commit
  `70c8b6c`) and an unguarded `./data` grep erroring loudly when
  the directory is absent (2026-07-23, commit `fe46a28`) — and
  the "Prune adopt-by-need files" sub-step missed two more of the
  ~12 adopt-by-need rows exactly as this candidate's proposed
  scope predicted: the `.claude/` Claude-Code-only bundle
  (2026-07-24, commit `9d404ce`) and `scripts/bootstrap.mjs`, the
  1009-line executor behind `/bootstrap` (2026-07-26, commit
  `0f19039`). Both prune misses are the identical failure this
  candidate already called out by name ("only gives worked
  removal steps for 4 of ~12 adopt-by-need rows") — the fix
  pattern is not finding new bug classes, it is re-confirming the
  one this candidate proposes to close structurally.
- rationale: tick-by-tick `/iterate` fixes keep patching this
  block and it keeps re-breaking on the next fresh-eyes pass —
  the strongest possible evidence that the block's *structure*
  (copy array + placeholder sweep + prune, spread loosely across
  steps 4-7) is the defect, not any single line in it. Signal B's
  cluster pattern, now sextupled across six re-evidencing dates,
  and no longer critique-only. Six ticks have each shipped a
  correct, narrow fix for one row/directory/mechanism at a time
  — none has shipped the structural rewrite that would stop the
  next instance before it's found by hand.
- proposed scope: rewrite playbooks/new-project.md's step 4 (copy)
  and its placeholder-replace step so paths match the README's
  recommended sibling-clone layout; add the missing
  `templates/plan/phases/` copy line (and re-sweep placeholders
  over it); widen the grep scope to every directory step 4
  populates (`./scripts`, `./.env.example`, `./data`) once,
  structurally, instead of patching one omitted directory per
  sweep; add an explicit
  adopt-by-need prune sub-step right after the bulk copy that
  covers all ~12 of `templates/README.md`'s adopt-by-need rows,
  not just the 6 already worked one at a time (Surface/
  Structured-data/UGC-gated/`.claude/`/`scripts/bootstrap.mjs`);
  fold step 7's now-redundant deploy-check.mjs copy
  into step 4's bulk copy and reword step 7 to "wire the file
  already present"; clarify step 6 describes the target shape for
  phase 1's brief to produce, not something to run against an
  empty repo. Carries all current CRITIQUE rows in this cluster to
  Done in the same commit (leaves the pnpm/settings.json row to
  the sibling candidate below, and the two single-instance LOW
  rows — step 2's bearings.md placeholder mismatch,
  `<PROJECT_PKG_PREFIX>`'s worked example — as plain `/iterate`
  ticks; they don't share this cluster's root cause).
- estimated phases: 1
- conflicts: none — tightens an existing playbook, no template
  API change.

### [ ] [score 7.6] Key custody map + hermetic keys lint
- proposed: 2026-07-03
- source signals: unattended windows die on "which file holds
  this token, where is it mirrored, when does it expire" —
  questions no kit file answers today.
- rationale: one greppable names-only registry row per
  credential (Key | Holder file | Minted by | Scopes | Mirrored
  to | Expires | Rotate via), updated in the same commit as the
  mint; a pure-string lint makes orphan/ghost/ambiguous keys a
  gate failure while staying offline.
- proposed scope: `templates/setup/00_keys.md`;
  `templates/scripts/keys-audit.mjs` (opt-in leg); hands-off.md
  pre-flight refuses a window that outlives any Expires cell;
  /bootstrap rotate consumes Mirrored-to as its propagation
  list.
- estimated phases: 1
- conflicts: builds on the two-ring topology + handshake rows.

### [ ] [score 7.5] Package nexus as a Claude Code plugin
- proposed: 2026-07-02 (design deepened 2026-07-03)
- source signals: adoption friction (clone + copy + replace is
  the whole TL;DR); Claude Code plugin/marketplace support.
- rationale: `/plugin install nexus` collapses adoption Step 1;
  the client-agnostic skills/ layout stays canonical. Deepened:
  the plugin ships adopt/upgrade/doctor commands ONLY — never
  the skill family, protecting the adopted-skills doctrine; the
  nexus repo is its own marketplace so push = publish survives.
- proposed scope: `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` at root;
  plugin/ generated by `scripts/build-plugin.mjs` (version ==
  KIT_VERSION, commands wrap the canonical prompts/, vendored
  templates snapshot for offline determinism); one verify leg
  regenerating in-memory and byte-diffing; `playbooks/plugin.md`.
- estimated phases: 1
- conflicts: ship after prompts/ + releases/lock — the plugin
  commands consume both.

### [ ] [score 7.4] plan/ carries the workspace: resurrection files + doctor
- proposed: 2026-07-03
- source signals: the un-versioned root's obvious objection —
  lose the machine, lose the topology. kintilla's plan repo
  already half-plays this role.
- rationale: make plan/ the versioned carrier: canonical copies
  of the root files, a names-only keys manifest, a clone map,
  and a zero-dependency offline doctor. New-machine flow: clone
  org/plan, copy root files up, clone per repos.md, re-run each
  runbook's human beat, doctor until green.
- proposed scope: `templates/workspace/plan-workspace/`
  (keys.md names-only manifest, repos.md clone map, root/
  canonical copies); `templates/workspace/workspace-doctor.mjs`
  (root-not-a-repo, repos exist, keys present by name, no
  secret path inside any repo tree); Resurrection section in
  playbooks/workspace.md; pointer in recovery.md.
- estimated phases: 1
- conflicts: rides the workspace playbook candidate.

### [ ] [score 7.3] Workspace-aware /bootstrap + /oversight
- proposed: 2026-07-03
- source signals: kintilla's cloudflare runbook fans one
  workspace token out to repo Actions secrets by hand.
- rationale: teach the executor the two rings — env resolution
  walks up (process env -> repo .env -> parent .env.workspace,
  with stop conditions), secret fan-out walks down (gh secret
  set per Mirrored-to target); a missing key's failure message
  points at the runbook that mints it.
- proposed scope: edits only — bootstrap-automation.md (env
  resolution order + fan-out), external-services.md (/oversight
  checks each key in its Holder file, names only), polyrepo.md
  (custody map rides the plan repo).
- estimated phases: 1
- conflicts: depends on two-ring topology + custody map.

### [ ] [score 7.2] Package-manager pluggability: the pnpm-only settings.json allowlist silently stalls npm/yarn/bun adopters
- proposed: 2026-07-10
- source signals: critique pass 3 (2026-07-10) —
  `playbooks/new-project.md:35`'s "sed-replace if you use
  npm/yarn/bun" caveat has no worked example and a naive
  `s/pnpm/npm/g` breaks command syntax (`npm typecheck` needs
  `run`); separately, and more seriously,
  `templates/claude/settings.json`'s permission allowlist is
  hardcoded to `Bash(pnpm verify:*)` / `Bash(pnpm test:*)` etc.
  with no equivalent for other package managers.
- rationale: an npm/yarn/bun adopter's verify-gate commands never
  match the allowlist, so every unattended cloud tick silently
  stalls on a permission prompt nobody is present to answer —
  this directly defeats `README.md`'s "leave it for 80 hours"
  pitch, the kit's core promise, for any adopter who isn't on
  pnpm. Adopter-facing and severe out of proportion to how small
  the fix is.
- proposed scope: either (a) generate
  `templates/claude/settings.json`'s allowlist entries from the
  package-manager choice already captured during onboarding
  (bootstrap.mjs already prompts/knows this), so npm/yarn/bun
  land with matching `Bash(<pm> ...)` entries in the same commit
  the placeholders resolve; or (b), if (a) is out of scope for one
  phase, state plainly in `new-project.md` and `README.md` that
  pnpm is a hard prerequisite until (a) ships, and give a real
  worked sed example for the interim manual path. Either way,
  fixes the allowlist/caveat mismatch `plan/CRITIQUE.md` flagged.
- estimated phases: 1
- conflicts: none — settings.json's allowlist shape is internal
  to the template, not public API (AGENTS.md rule 7 covers
  paths + placeholder vocabulary, not allowlist contents).

### [ ] [score 7.1] npx nexus-adopt: the mechanical half as an initializer
- proposed: 2026-07-03
- source signals: clone + copy + placeholder-replace is
  mechanical work no agent needs judgment for.
- rationale: a zero-dependency initializer does the mechanical
  half (infer placeholders from git remote/branch/dirname,
  shallow-clone at the latest tag, copy per the templates
  contract, write plan/nexus.lock) then prints exactly one
  paste line handing the judgment half to ANY agent.
- proposed scope: packaging/npx/ (bin + small test); release.yml
  publishing on tag push (one NPM_TOKEN secret); README
  one-command variant above the paste.
- estimated phases: 1
- conflicts: ship after prompts/ + releases; npm is a second
  publish surface to keep in lockstep.

### [ ] [score 7.0] ADOPTERS.md wall + badge + opt-in hatch beacon
- proposed: 2026-07-03
- source signals: the only zero-cost growth loop available under
  the $0-marginal constraint.
- rationale: registry rows are trivially mergeable community
  PRs; the differentiated part is the beacon — an adopter's
  first green tick (opt-in, off by default, loudly so) files a
  "hatched" issue with verifiable first-tick evidence, and
  /triage is the spam gate.
- proposed scope: ADOPTERS.md seeded with the provenance
  projects + paste-ready badge snippet; README "projects that
  ship themselves" strip; NEXUS_HATCH_OPTIN= (empty default) in
  env.example; one fires-once step in ship-a-phase.md; a
  hatched route in triage.md.
- estimated phases: 1
- conflicts: beacon must stay opt-in or it reads as phone-home
  telemetry in a kit whose brand is "you own everything".

### [ ] [score 5.5] playbooks/outgrow.md — the split ceremony
- proposed: 2026-07-03
- source signals: judged premature — no second real migration to
  validate the ceremony against yet.
- rationale: the single-repo -> workspace split will eventually
  need a numbered, safe ceremony; write it when the first real
  split happens and can serve as its test case.
- proposed scope: deferred; the workspace playbook's decision
  matrix + polyrepo.md cover the ladder's endpoints until then.
- estimated phases: 1
- conflicts: none.

### [ ] [score 6.8] closeloop: thank the humans who file issues
- proposed: 2026-07-02
- source signals: kintilla's `.claude/tools/closeloop.mjs`
  (Postmark batch thank-you emails to issue reporters,
  dry-run default, tested).
- rationale: the address loop closes with the fix; closing
  with the *reporter* compounds trust. Generalize as an
  opt-in template next to loop-issue.mjs.
- proposed scope: `templates/scripts/closeloop.mjs` +
  customization section in the triage/moderation story.
- estimated phases: 1
- conflicts: email provider becomes an optional external
  service (runbook required).

### [ ] [score 6.1] Critique-household pattern for auth-aware critique
- proposed: 2026-07-02
- source signals: kintilla's planned `/visit` seals an
  anonymous "critique household" so the observer never
  consents to analytics (no GA4 pollution) — a pattern
  auth-aware-critique.md doesn't cover.
- rationale: adds the "observer must not pollute product
  analytics/data" dimension to the five auth patterns.
- proposed scope: new section in
  `customization/auth-aware-critique.md` + env conventions.
- estimated phases: 1
- conflicts: none.

### [ ] [score 5.9] Staged hardening for verify legs
- proposed: 2026-07-02
- source signals: kintilla's `check.mjs` `*_IS_ERROR` flags —
  new invariants start as warnings, flip to errors once the
  corpus drains.
- rationale: lets adopters (and this repo) add aggressive lint
  legs without a big-bang cleanup; the flip commit is the
  celebration.
- proposed scope: warn-tier support in `scripts/verify.mjs` +
  a paragraph in verify-gate.md.
- estimated phases: 1
- conflicts: none.

### [promoted 2026-08-23 → phase 20] [score 8.5] Cloud march ticks must not dispatch background/async agents
- proposed: 2026-07-17 (digest); re-evidenced 2026-08-02
  (expand pass 6)
- source signals: the 2026-07-17 03:04 UTC cloud tick (run
  `29551508864`) reached `/iterate`'s audit-refresh step, found
  `plan/AUDIT.md` >24h stale, and launched an async background
  subagent to run the A-G sweep instead of running it inline.
  The log shows it explicitly deciding to "wait for the audit
  agent to finish," then the GitHub Actions job's own
  `terminal_reason` flips to `completed` ~4 seconds later — no
  commit, no verify run, no trace of the subagent's output ever
  landing. The very next tick (07-17 08:45, run `29567537795`)
  hit the identical stale-audit branch but ran the sweep inline
  and shipped cleanly in ~6 minutes (commit `4ca0c36`), proving
  the sweep itself isn't the bottleneck — the async dispatch
  pattern is. 1 of 4 ticks in that 26h window was silently lost
  this way (full pulse in `plan/DIGEST.md` 2026-07-17). Signal E
  (platform drift), 2026-08-02: Claude Code's own Agent tool
  description, current as of this pass (confirmed both via the
  in-session tool schema and `code.claude.com/docs/en/whats-new`
  Week 27, June 29 - July 3 2026: "subagents run in the
  background by default so Claude keeps working while they
  run"), now states "Agents run in the background by default...
  Pass run_in_background: false to run an agent in the
  foreground." That changed the failure mode this candidate was
  written against: the original evidence was one tick explicitly
  requesting background mode, but the platform default has since
  flipped, so *any* `Agent(...)` call in a cloud tick that omits
  `run_in_background` now backgrounds itself — not just calls
  that opt in.
- rationale: a GitHub Actions job is a single-shot process —
  once the step (and the job) exits there is nothing left
  running to deliver a background agent's completion
  notification, so dispatching `Agent(..., run_in_background:
  true)`-style work inside a cloud march tick is a guaranteed
  no-op, not a performance win. `templates/.github/workflows/march.yml`
  runs the identical one-shot pattern, so every adopter's cloud
  loop carries the same latent trap. With backgrounding now the
  platform default rather than an opt-in, the omission case (no
  `run_in_background` param at all) is at least as likely to
  bite an unattended cloud tick as the explicit-`true` case this
  candidate was originally scored against — raising both
  likelihood and adopter-facing severity.
- proposed scope: add an explicit "cloud ticks run
  synchronously — every Agent call must pass
  `run_in_background: false` explicitly; the platform default is
  background as of mid-2026, so omitting the param is itself a
  background dispatch" line to the cloud-mode prompt block in
  `.github/workflows/march.yml` and its `templates/` mirror,
  plus a matching failure-mode entry in `.github/CLOUD_LOOP.md`
  ("a tick logs launching a background/async audit agent then
  exits clean with no commit" -> this root cause) and a note on
  `skills/iterate.md`'s audit-delegation step.
- estimated phases: 1 (doc/prompt-only, no template API change)
- conflicts: none.

### [ ] [score 6.5] Mechanically verify the Cloud-Run trailer on cloud ticks
- proposed: 2026-07-20 (digest); re-evidenced 2026-07-26 (digest)
- source signals: of the 4 cloud commits shipped in the trailing
  24h window (2026-07-19 14:31 to 2026-07-20 09:07 UTC — all
  4 `march` runs green, no failures), 1 — `a74f7b6` ("critique:
  pass 6 — 4 findings (2 high, 2 med)", from the 2026-07-19
  20:18 UTC tick) — landed with no `Cloud-Run:` trailer at all,
  breaking AGENTS.md rule 2's carve-out. The workflow's own
  ceiling check (`march.yml`'s "Daily commit ceiling check"
  step) counts cloud volume by `git log --grep='Cloud-Run:'`,
  so this commit silently doesn't count toward the 8/24h
  ceiling either — the miss is invisible from both the rule
  side and the counting side. `scripts/verify.mjs` runs
  foreground on every tick but has no leg that inspects the
  commit trailer, since it can't distinguish a cloud commit
  from a local one at gate time. Second instance found
  2026-07-26 (digest): `427eb91` ("critique: pass 8 — 2 findings
  (0 high, 1 med, 1 low)", from the 2026-07-25 20:20 UTC tick)
  repeats the identical gap — confirmed via
  `gh run view 30173383094 --log`, whose prompt block quotes the
  exact trailer text verbatim, yet the shipped commit has no
  body at all. Both observed misses are `/critique` verb commits
  specifically (`a74f7b6`, `427eb91`), never an `/iterate` or
  `/expand` commit in the ~60 cloud ticks sampled by digest
  passes to date — narrows the likely root cause from "any
  cloud commit can drop the trailer" to "the critique skill's
  own commit step doesn't append it," which changes where the
  eventual fix should look first.
- rationale: the trailer is the sole mechanism the ceiling
  trusts; a tick that forgets it both violates the standing
  rule silently and erodes the ceiling's accuracy in the
  direction that's hardest to notice (undercounting, not
  overcounting). Two misses now observed, both on the same verb,
  is a pattern, not a one-off.
- proposed scope: a post-agent step in `march.yml` (and its
  `templates/` mirror) that diffs `HEAD` against the pre-run
  SHA when the ceiling didn't skip, and — if new commits landed
  without the trailer on all of them — opens an unlabeled
  issue naming the offending SHA (the loud-not-silent pattern
  AGENTS.md rule 6 already prescribes elsewhere). Gate-side
  enforcement isn't possible (verify.mjs can't tell cloud from
  local commits), so this has to live in the workflow, not the
  gate.
- estimated phases: 1 (workflow-only, no template API change)
- conflicts: none.

### [ ] [score 6.0] AUDIT's unwritten "favor the queue" tie-break is starving a cheap, real AUDIT-native row
- proposed: 2026-07-24 (digest)
- source signals: `plan/AUDIT.md`'s `[A/E, 2.7]` row (README's
  "Files added" checklist undersells `scripts/` — impact 3,
  ease 9, one of the cheapest fixes in the file) first appeared
  around cloud tick 2026-07-17 and has since been cited as tied
  or narrowly outscored by a `plan/CRITIQUE.md` row in at least
  ten separate tick log-lines through 2026-07-24, every single
  time it was in contention. The tie-break that keeps beating it
  ("favor the queue") is a real, consistently-applied
  convention, but it exists only as repeated log narrative in
  `plan/AUDIT.md` — it was never written into `skills/iterate.md`
  §3 as an actual rule, so nobody can inspect or challenge it as
  policy, and it has no aging counter-pressure.
- rationale: a one-line, ease-9 fix sitting seven-plus days
  unshipped purely because of an unwritten scoring convention is
  exactly the "starved queue" pattern `skills/digest.md` §4 names
  as a tuning trigger — not because the fix is hard, risky, or
  actually low-value.
- proposed scope: write the "favor the queue on ties" convention
  explicitly into `skills/iterate.md` §3 as an inspectable rule,
  paired with a small aging nudge (e.g. `+0.1` per tick an AUDIT
  row is passed over on a tie, capped) so a persistently-tied
  cheap row eventually wins instead of losing indefinitely.
- estimated phases: 1 (doc/rule-only, no template API change)
- conflicts: none.

### [promoted 2026-08-23 → phase 23] [score 7.8] Cloud tick failure auto-alarm
- proposed: 2026-08-23 (oversight, user-directed)
- source signals: the 2026-08-02 → 2026-08-23 outage — every
  scheduled march/night tick for 21 days (~84 runs) failed at
  checkout on an expired `ACTIONS_PAT` (401), and nothing filed
  an issue. The heartbeat's flatline alarm was blind to it
  (`--status completed` counts failed runs — fixed this same
  session) and no other watcher exists for failure streaks.
- rationale: AGENTS.md rule 6 (blocked is loud) must apply to
  the loop's own infrastructure. The default `GITHUB_TOKEN`
  survives PAT death and can still file issues.
- proposed scope: an `if: failure()` step in `march.yml` and
  `night.yml` (nexus + `templates/` mirrors) that files a
  deduped "cloud tick failing" issue via `GITHUB_TOKEN`, naming
  the failed step and linking the run. (Both halves shippable
  by the loop since the 2026-08-23 PAT re-scope added
  Workflows read/write.)
- estimated phases: 1
- conflicts: complements the heartbeat fix and the Cloud-Run
  trailer candidate (6.5); overlaps neither.

### [promoted 2026-08-23 → phase 24] [score 7.5] scripts/pulse.mjs — the offline instrument panel
- proposed: 2026-08-23 (oversight, user-directed)
- source signals: this oversight session hand-assembled the
  same panel (queue counts, last-tick age, blocked rows,
  candidate silt) from six files and two `gh` calls; `/digest`
  re-derives it nightly in prose; `/oversight audit` re-derives
  it again.
- rationale: one hermetic script, three consumers — digest,
  oversight, and a human at a terminal — and the numbers stop
  drifting between hand-counts.
- proposed scope: `scripts/pulse.mjs` (zero-dependency: queue
  Pending counts, last-commit age, build-plan pending/blocked
  rows, candidate count + oldest-pending age; reads git
  locally, never the network); `/digest` and `/oversight` cite
  it; `templates/scripts/` twin with the same contract.
- estimated phases: 1
- conflicts: none.

### [promoted 2026-08-23 → phase 25] [score 7.7] scripts/adopt-dryrun.mjs — mechanize the dry-run adoption walk
- proposed: 2026-08-23 (oversight, user-directed)
- source signals: the step-4 cluster (the 9.0 candidate, now
  phase 19) re-broke across eight re-evidencing dates because
  only fresh-eyes critique passes ever exercise the documented
  copy + placeholder-sweep path — the gate never does.
- rationale: turn the recurring critique cluster into a
  mechanical check: if the documented adoption commands break,
  a script fails before a stranger ever hits it.
- proposed scope: `scripts/adopt-dryrun.mjs` — executes the
  playbook's step-4 copy array + placeholder sweep into a temp
  dir, asserts zero unresolved `<...>` tokens and the expected
  file manifest, cleans up; opt-in verify leg (env-gated so the
  default gate stays fast); `skills/critique.md` points its
  mechanical half at the script and spends its passes on
  comprehension findings instead.
- estimated phases: 1
- conflicts: lands best after phase 19 settles the block it
  verifies; sequence 19 first.

### [promoted 2026-08-23 → phase 26] [score 7.0] Issue templates keyed to triage routes
- proposed: 2026-08-23 (oversight, user-directed)
- source signals: `/triage` classifies unlabeled issues into a
  fixed routing vocabulary, but reporters get a blank textarea
  — every route is re-derived from freeform prose.
- rationale: structured forms make triage's classification
  step cheaper and dedupe obvious (a form names its route);
  reporters get DX, the loop gets cleaner input.
- proposed scope: `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/*.yml` forms mapped
  to triage's routes (bug/friction/idea/needs-user), a
  config.yml disabling blank issues softly, `templates/`
  mirror, and a note in `skills/triage.md` + its template twin
  that pre-labeled forms short-circuit classification.
- estimated phases: 1
- conflicts: none.

### [promoted 2026-08-23 → phase 27] [score 6.8] scripts/new-skill.mjs — skill scaffolder
- proposed: 2026-08-23 (oversight, user-directed)
- source signals: `concepts/skills-anatomy.md` documents the
  canonical skill shape, but every new skill file (15 shipped
  in `templates/skills/` so far) is hand-copied from a sibling
  and hand-renamed — the anatomy drift the gate's anatomy leg
  keeps catching starts here.
- rationale: scaffold from the anatomy, and new skills are
  born gate-green instead of converging on it.
- proposed scope: `scripts/new-skill.mjs <name> "<purpose>"` —
  emits `skills/<name>.md` (or `templates/skills/` with a
  flag) pre-filled with the canonical sections + a matching
  `.claude/commands/<name>.md` pointer stub; refuses names
  that collide; `templates/scripts/` twin.
- estimated phases: 1
- conflicts: none.

### [promoted 2026-08-23 → phase 28] [score 7.2] Commit-verb vocabulary lint in the guard hook
- proposed: 2026-08-23 (oversight, user-directed)
- source signals: the repo's whole history uses a stable verb
  vocabulary (`docs:`, `fix:`, `critique:`, `digest:`,
  `expand:`, `triage:`, `oversight:`, `phase N:` …) and the
  weighted ceiling (phase 17) *counts* by verb — but nothing
  enforces the prefix, so one misspelled verb silently
  miscounts the ceiling and pollutes the velocity read.
- rationale: the vocabulary is load-bearing (ceiling weights,
  digest pulse, oversight verb-mix) — make it mechanical.
- proposed scope: a `RULES` entry in `.claude/hooks/guard.mjs`
  (which already inspects `git commit` commands) rejecting
  commit messages whose first token isn't in the documented
  verb set; the set itself documented in `plan/bearings.md`;
  self-test cases; `templates/claude/hooks/` twin.
- estimated phases: 1
- conflicts: none.

### [promoted 2026-08-23 → phase 29] [score 7.4] Dual-shell parity lint leg for playbooks
- proposed: 2026-08-23 (oversight, user-directed)
- source signals: `playbooks/windows-notes.md` promises every
  playbook code block works as written on both shells, yet
  three separate bash-only scope/portability bugs shipped
  (`sed -i` on BSD, unguarded `./data` grep, PowerShell twin
  drifting from its bash sibling) and were each caught by
  hand, one critique pass at a time.
- rationale: the promise is checkable: every bash fence in a
  playbook either has an adjacent PowerShell twin or carries
  an explicit posix-only marker.
- proposed scope: a `dualshell` leg in `scripts/verify.mjs`
  walking `playbooks/*.md` code fences, pairing bash blocks
  with their PowerShell siblings, failing on unpaired blocks
  unless annotated; annotate the legitimate posix-only blocks
  in the same commit (the gate-teaching rule).
- estimated phases: 1
- conflicts: none.

### [promoted 2026-08-23 → phase 30] [score 6.9] Candidate-aging silt guard in digest/expand
- proposed: 2026-08-23 (oversight, user-directed)
- source signals: 20 candidates accumulated over 7 weeks with
  zero promotions; the top scorer (9.0) was re-evidenced eight
  times while waiting. Nothing surfaces "the queue is silting"
  until a human happens to run `/oversight`.
- rationale: `skills/digest.md` already names "starved queue"
  as a tuning trigger — give it the number that trips it.
- proposed scope: `/digest`'s pulse gains a standing line
  (count of candidates pending >21 days + the oldest's age)
  and flags "oversight needed: candidate queue silting" past a
  threshold; `/expand` stamps a `last re-evidenced` date it
  already tracks informally; doc-only edits to
  `skills/digest.md`, `skills/expand.md`, and their template
  twins.
- estimated phases: 1
- conflicts: none.

### [promoted 2026-08-23 → phase 31] [score 6.7] scripts/install-hooks.mjs — opt-in pre-commit gate
- proposed: 2026-08-23 (oversight, user-directed)
- source signals: the verify gate binds the *loop* (skills run
  it foreground before commit), but a human editing outside
  the loop — exactly this oversight session's fix commits —
  relies on remembering to run it.
- rationale: one command arms the same gate for hand commits;
  opt-in keeps clone-and-read adopters unaffected.
- proposed scope: `scripts/install-hooks.mjs` writing a
  `.git/hooks/pre-commit` that runs `node scripts/verify.mjs`
  (and nothing else — no network, no formatting); an
  uninstall flag; a one-line mention in README's "Files
  added" + `templates/scripts/` twin wired to the adopter's
  gate command.
- estimated phases: 1
- conflicts: none.

### [promoted 2026-08-23 → phase 32] [score 7.1] Scheduled-workflow auto-disable watch in heartbeat
- proposed: 2026-08-23 (oversight, user-directed)
- source signals: GitHub silently disables cron workflows
  after 60 days without repo activity — a hazard the Aug 2–23
  outage walked toward (21 days of zero commits) and the kit
  never mentions. The heartbeat also only measures `march`:
  `night.yml` failed for the same 21 days with no watcher at
  all, and a schedule that GitHub has *disabled* produces no
  runs for the flatline check to even measure.
- rationale: the watchdog should watch armed-ness, not just
  run recency, and should cover every scheduled workflow.
- proposed scope: heartbeat gains a leg that checks
  `gh workflow list` for `disabled_inactivity`/manually
  disabled march/night/heartbeat and widens the flatline
  check to `night`; alarm via the existing deduped-issue
  pattern; document the 60-day rule in
  `playbooks/cloud-loop.md` + `templates/.github/CLOUD_LOOP.md`.
  (Both halves shippable by the loop since the 2026-08-23 PAT
  re-scope added Workflows read/write.)
- estimated phases: 1
- conflicts: rides the heartbeat fix landed this session.
