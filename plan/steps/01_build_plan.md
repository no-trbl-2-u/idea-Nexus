# 01 — Build plan (nexus on nexus)

> Style guardrails for every phase: match the voice exemplars
> in `plan/bearings.md`; every new doc discoverable (linked +
> in the README tree) in the same commit; every new invariant
> teaches the gate in the same commit; hard-wrap ~62–64 cols.

## Status (at-a-glance)

`/march` and `/ship-a-phase` read this block to find the next
phase. Status vocabulary: `[ ]` pending → `[x]` shipped (with
commit hash); `[skipped]` (only via `/oversight`);
`[blocked: <reason> <date>]` (`/march` skips, `/oversight`
unblocks). Tick in the same commit that ships the phase.

**Substrate (the ouroboros):**
- [x] Phase 1 — The kit itself (pre-adoption history,
      b27d21f → cf05598: methodology, templates, playbooks,
      customization, bootstrap layer)
- [x] Phase 2 — The kit's own verify gate (commit 84ea179)
- [x] Phase 3 — Harness enforcement layer + template
      hardening for unattended runs (commit e593606)
- [x] Phase 4 — Hands-off + recovery playbooks; claude-code +
      lanes customization (commit fe75c78)
- [x] Phase 5 — Self-adoption substrate: AGENTS.md, plan/,
      skills/, .claude/ (this commit)
- [x] Phase 6 — Cloud loop: nexus marches on Actions,
      Sonnet 5, 4 ticks/day (this commit; armed once the
      `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` repo secret exists)

**Growth (the loop's food — briefs in `plan/phases/` where
written):**
- [x] Phase 7 — Lessons layer: reflexes + domain-keyed lessons
      with hard caps, extracted from kintilla (this commit)
- [x] Phase 8 — Polyrepo variant playbook: plan/ as its own
      repo + sibling product repos (commit 4dc4840)
- [x] Phase 9 — Windows-first pass: dual-shell commands +
      hazards page (this commit)
- [x] Phase 10 — Ship `templates/skills/moderate.md` — the
      moderation Option A that moderation-loop.md promises
      (this commit)
- [x] Phase 11 — Ship `templates/skills/ship-migration.md` +
      additive-migration linter — data-layer Pattern D promise
      (this commit)
- [x] Phase 12 — Critique-session refresher script + secret
      liveness probes — auth-aware-critique promise (this
      commit)
- [x] Phase 13 — Nightly full-smoke workflow template +
      stack:up/down scripts — hermetic-e2e promise (this
      commit)
- [x] Phase 14 — Bootstrap v2: de-stub cloud-loop verbs,
      runbook status write-back, vercel --sensitive, Supabase
      key extraction (the Ember lessons list) (this commit)
- [x] Phase 15 — Brownfield kit: templates/plan/CURRENT-STATE.md
      + preview-branch deploy-gate pattern (this commit)
- [x] Phase 16 — Heartbeat watchdog: model-free workflow that
      cancels wedged runs and alarms on flatline — nexus +
      template (this commit)
- [x] Phase 17 — Budget-aware ceiling: read
      bootstrap.local.json cloud_loop.daily_ceiling; weight
      phase commits vs churn commits (this commit)
- [x] Phase 18 — Loop shapes: the genus taxonomy
      (`concepts/loop-shapes.md`), the night shift (`/digest`
      + `night.yml` + `plan/DIGEST.md`), and the concierge
      lane (`loop:do` + verb dispatch) — kit + ouroboros
      (this commit)

**Drain (promoted 2026-08-23 via `/oversight` — full briefs in
`plan/PHASE_CANDIDATES.md` → Promoted, which also carries the
four relabeled `[promoted …]` entries still sitting under its
Pending section for their evidence trails):**

## Carry-overs / known gaps

- `plan/AUDIT.md`'s Pending section holds iterate-sized
  findings from the survey passes — they compete with phases
  via `/march` order (phases first). Count drifts every pass;
  read the file for the live total, not this bullet.
- `plan/PHASE_CANDIDATES.md`'s Pending section holds candidates
  awaiting `/oversight` promotion, including plugin packaging,
  closeloop, critique-household, and staged hardening among
  others added since. Count drifts every pass; read the file
  for the live total, not this bullet.
- Workflows-scope history: until 2026-08-23 `ACTIONS_PAT` had
  no `workflows` scope, so phases touching
  `.github/workflows/*.yml` shipped only the `templates/` half
  (issue #12 waited 7 weeks for a local session this way). The
  re-minted PAT grants Workflows read/write, so cloud ticks
  now push those files themselves — see `AGENTS.md`
  "Operational secrets" for the scope rationale.
