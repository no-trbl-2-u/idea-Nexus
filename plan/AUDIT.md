# Kit audit — 2026-09-01

> Bias: none

Cloud tick 2026-07-12 (first): picked [2.1] over the
higher-scoring [user-issue #12] because #12's fix touches
`.github/workflows/march.yml`, which `ACTIONS_PAT` cannot push
(no `workflows` scope, by design — see its own evidence). Left
#12 pending for a human or locally-run `/iterate` with a
workflow-scoped token, per its `next`.

Cloud tick 2026-07-12 (second): #12 still the only AUDIT row
and still blocked for the same reason, so this tick shipped the
next highest-scoring queue item instead — `plan/CRITIQUE.md`'s
MED "sed one-liner's scope misses files" row (queue rows
compete with AUDIT rows on the same scale, per `skills/iterate.md`
§3). AUDIT block otherwise unchanged; still <24h old.

Cloud tick 2026-07-12 (third): #12 still the sole AUDIT row,
still blocked (no `workflows`-scoped token in this environment).
Shipped `plan/CRITIQUE.md`'s remaining MED row — the blanket
`skills/` copy contradicting the adopt-by-need contract. AUDIT
block otherwise unchanged; still <24h old.

Cloud tick 2026-07-13: #12 still the only AUDIT row, still
blocked (no `workflows`-scoped token in this environment).
Re-scored `plan/CRITIQUE.md`'s pending queue (five MED, four
LOW rows) and shipped the highest-scoring one — the README /
playbook estimated-time contradiction (agent-paced vs
human-paced figures reading as flatly incompatible) — over the
prune-table-coverage and bootstrap-manifest-placeholder MED
rows, both larger edits for a similar score. Not a fresh A-G
sweep; last full sweep still 2026-07-11 (below).

Cloud tick 2026-07-14: #12 still the only AUDIT row, still
blocked for the same reason. Re-scored `plan/CRITIQUE.md`'s
remaining queue (three MED, four LOW) and shipped the
bootstrap-manifest-placeholder MED row — cheapest fix of the
three MEDs (a one-line note + scoped sed, vs. the prune-table
row's five new worked examples and the npm/yarn/bun row's
settings.json-allowlist redesign). Not a fresh A-G sweep; last
full sweep still 2026-07-11.

Second full dimension sweep (A-G) since phase 18 ended the
build plan. Re-verified the two rows still pending from the
2026-07-09 pass (both confirmed real) and swept fresh for new
drift: templates/ vs. both tree diagrams, verify.mjs's own leg
coverage, model-id freshness, and placeholder-sample accuracy.
Sibling lessons files (`../kintilla`, `../semilayer`) still not
present in this checkout — dimension G came up empty, not
skipped. No stale/invented model ids found; placeholder table
still correctly 8 entries.

Third full dimension sweep (A-G), cloud tick 2026-07-14 — first
full A-G sweep since 2026-07-11 (the intervening four ticks
only re-scored `plan/CRITIQUE.md`'s pending queue, per their own
log lines above). Dimension G still empty (no sibling lessons
files present). Top finding shipped this tick (below); four more
queued to Pending, ranked below `[user-issue #12]` which stays
the oldest row but remains blocked on a workflows-scoped token.

Cloud tick 2026-07-14 (second): #12 still the only blocked row.
Verified and shipped the next-highest scorer — the
`thock.netlify.app` link rot (score 4.8) — over the two
remaining A-class rows (4.2, 3.2) which score lower. Not a fresh
A-G sweep; last full sweep still today's third sweep above.

Cloud tick 2026-07-14 (third): #12 still the only blocked row.
Shipped the next-highest scorer — the README command-table
completeness row (score 4.2) — but narrowed its scope: added
`/digest` (main table) and `/moderate` (opt-in table), skipped
`/lessons-pr`. `skills/lessons-pr.md` documents itself as a
nexus-self meta-skill adopters never copy (confirmed: no
`templates/skills/lessons-pr.md` exists), so listing it beside
adopter-facing commands in "What you get" would misrepresent it
as something adopters run in their own repo. The existing
forward-reference at README.md:237 (capture lessons during
adoption, land them via a later `/lessons-pr` pass *against the
nexus repo*) already covers it accurately.

Cloud tick 2026-07-15: #12 still the only blocked row (same
`ACTIONS_PAT` scope constraint). Shipped the next-highest
scorer — the "six skill files" stale count (score 3.2, [A,
3.2] below) — over the `scripts/` checklist row (2.7). Not a
fresh A-G sweep; last full sweep still cloud tick 2026-07-14
(third).

Cloud tick 2026-07-17: fresh sweep of C (link rot — no new dead
links beyond the already-fixed `thock.netlify.app`, which now
only appears in historical AUDIT/DIGEST log prose, not live
docs), F (model-id freshness — `claude-sonnet-5`,
`claude-haiku-4-5`, `claude-opus-4-8` all current, none stale),
and G (sibling lessons — `../kintilla/plan/lessons.md` and any
`NEXUS_LESSONS.md` still absent from this checkout, dimension
empty). A/B/D leaned on `verify.mjs`'s green tree and emoji
legs rather than a manual re-derive. #12 still the only blocked
AUDIT row. Shipped `plan/CRITIQUE.md`'s top-scoring pending row
— the `.claude/commands/*.md` dead-pointer gap in the
adopt-by-need prune instructions (MED, reproduced and
confirmed real) — over the remaining MED (pnpm/npm allowlist
conflict, larger redesign-shaped fix) and six LOW rows.

Cloud tick 2026-07-17 (second): #12 still the only blocked AUDIT
row. Re-scored `plan/CRITIQUE.md`'s remaining queue (one MED, six
LOW) and shipped the MED — the npm/yarn/bun sed-replace row —
over the AUDIT block's own `[A/E, 2.7]` row (lower score) and the
prune-coverage MED (larger edit, similar impact). Took the
suggested fix's cheaper option: state pnpm as a hard prerequisite
for the unattended path instead of building an unmaintained
worked npm/yarn/bun example. Not a fresh A-G sweep; last full
sweep still today's first tick (above).

Cloud tick 2026-07-17 (third): #12 still the only blocked AUDIT
row. Shipped the last remaining MED in `plan/CRITIQUE.md`'s
queue — the prune-coverage row deferred by the previous tick —
over the AUDIT block's own `[A/E, 2.7]` row (lower score) and six
remaining LOW rows. Extended `playbooks/new-project.md`'s prune
subsection to the five files the finding reproduced as surviving
(`skills/digest.md`, `skills/bootstrap.md`,
`scripts/refresh-critique-session.mjs`,
`scripts/check-secrets-liveness.mjs`, `scripts/stack-lifecycle.mjs`)
and closed a related gap surfaced while fixing it: `templates/README.md`'s
adopt-by-need table never had a row for `skills/bootstrap.md` in
the first place. `plan/CRITIQUE.md`'s pending queue is now six
LOW rows only. Not a fresh A-G sweep; last full sweep still
today's first tick (above).

Cloud tick 2026-07-18: #12 still the only blocked AUDIT row.
Re-scored `plan/CRITIQUE.md`'s remaining queue (all six LOW rows)
and shipped the highest scorer — the step-2 `bearings.md`
placeholder-list mismatch (score ~3.2) — over the AUDIT block's
own `[A/E, 2.7]` row and the other five LOW rows (2.4 and under).
Reproducing the finding surfaced a second, deeper bug in the same
root cause: `<PROJECT_TAGLINE>` was never an actual literal token
in `templates/plan/bearings.md` either (it used a freeform
`<ONE-LINE PRODUCT DESCRIPTION>` placeholder instead), so the
canonical 8-placeholder contract silently no-opped on the tagline
for every adopter — fixed alongside the originally-reported
`<REPO_SLUG>`/`<DEFAULT_BRANCH>` swap. Not a fresh A-G sweep; last
full sweep still 2026-07-17 (above).

Cloud tick 2026-07-18 (second): #12 still the only blocked AUDIT
row. Re-scored `plan/CRITIQUE.md`'s remaining queue (five LOW
rows) and shipped the highest scorer — the README TL;DR vs "How
to use this kit" missing cross-reference (score ~3.6) — over the
AUDIT block's own `[A/E, 2.7]` row and the four remaining LOW
rows (2.4 and under). Not a fresh A-G sweep; last full sweep
still 2026-07-17 (above).

Cloud tick 2026-07-18 (third): #12 still the only blocked AUDIT
row. Re-scored `plan/CRITIQUE.md`'s remaining queue (four LOW
rows) against the AUDIT block's own `[A/E, 2.7]` row (tied
score) and shipped the CRITIQUE row — the step-7
`deploy-check.mjs` redundant-copy instruction (score ~2.7,
oldest pending queue row, dry-run-sourced) — as the cheaper,
more confidently-scoped single-line reword. Not a fresh A-G
sweep; last full sweep still 2026-07-17 (above).

Cloud tick 2026-07-19: #12 still the only blocked AUDIT row.
Re-scored `plan/CRITIQUE.md`'s remaining queue (three LOW rows)
against the AUDIT block's own `[A/E, 2.7]` row (tied score) and
shipped the CRITIQUE row — the step-6 package.json-doesn't-
exist-yet ordering row, oldest pending queue row — over the two
other LOW rows and the tied AUDIT row, continuing the pattern of
favoring the queue on ties (cheaper, single-section edit). Not a
fresh A-G sweep; last full sweep still 2026-07-17 (above).

Cloud tick 2026-07-19 (second): #12 still the only blocked AUDIT
row. Re-scored `plan/CRITIQUE.md`'s remaining queue (two LOW
rows) against the AUDIT block's own `[A/E, 2.7]` row (tied
score). Reproducing the `PROJECT_PKG_PREFIX` row found it
already resolved — an earlier commit (`[x] [2.1]` above) had
already replaced `templates/README.md`'s truncated worked
example with a pointer to `playbooks/new-project.md` §4, whose
one-liners fully cover the placeholder; left it in Pending
rather than closing without a `/critique` pass re-confirming
(this skill doesn't author CRITIQUE rows, per iterate.md §5.4).
Shipped the step-8 sub-agent redundant-copy row instead — tied
score, same ordering-bug class as the already-fixed step-6/
step-7 rows, cheaper single-section edit. Not a fresh A-G sweep;
last full sweep still 2026-07-17 (above).

Digest tick 2026-07-19: fresh A-G sweep (header was 50h old,
past the digest's 48h threshold). A/B (doc-drift,
completeness), C (link + tree hygiene beyond the gate), D
(voice), E (adopter friction), and F (model-id freshness) all
manually re-derived rather than leaning on a <24h-old block.
G stays empty (no sibling lessons files present in this
checkout). #12 still the only blocked AUDIT row. Confirmed
`[A/E, 2.7]` (README's "Files added" checklist undersells
`scripts/`) still reproduces unchanged at `README.md:170-171`.
Found two new rows: README's own kit-tree omits
`PHASE_CANDIDATES.md` and `CURRENT-STATE.md` under
`templates/plan/` (both exist on disk and both are correctly
listed in `templates/README.md`'s own tree — `scripts/verify.mjs`'s
tree-reverse-check doesn't cover `templates/plan`, so the gap is
invisible to the gate), and a fictional example URL in
`templates/skills/bootstrap.md:217` now resolving to an
unrelated live site (plain text in a code block, not a
hyperlink, so the gate's links leg correctly skips it — low
severity). Audit only; digest ships nothing — see
`skills/digest.md` rule 2.

Cloud tick 2026-07-19 (third): #12 still the only blocked AUDIT
row. Shipped the next-highest scorer — the digest-sourced
`[A/C, 3.2]` row (README's kit-tree omitting `PHASE_CANDIDATES.md`
and `CURRENT-STATE.md`) — over the `[A/E, 2.7]` and `[C/F, 1.6]`
rows, both lower-scoring. Not a fresh A-G sweep; last full sweep
still today's digest tick (above).

Cloud tick 2026-07-20: #12 still the only blocked AUDIT row.
`/critique` pass 6 (previous tick) landed two fresh HIGH rows in
`plan/CRITIQUE.md`, both outscoring this block's own `[A/E, 2.7]`
and `[C/F, 1.6]` rows on the shared scale. Shipped the
higher-impact of the two — the `<PROJECT_PKG_PREFIX>` double-`@`
corruption (`templates/skills/ship-a-phase.md:206-207`,
`customization/verify-gate.md:56`) — over the sibling HIGH row
(`playbooks/new-project.md:515-516`'s nonexistent `pnpm
bootstrap:status` command), reasoning the double-`@` bug fails
silently (a plausible-looking but wrong package specifier lands
in an adopter's docs) where the sibling row fails loud ("missing
script", immediately visible and easy to recover from) — same
impact/ease numerically, higher true cost from harder detection.
Not a fresh A-G sweep; last full sweep still the 2026-07-19
digest tick (above).

Cloud tick 2026-07-20 (second): #12 still the only blocked
AUDIT row. Shipped the remaining `plan/CRITIQUE.md` HIGH row —
`playbooks/new-project.md:515-516`'s nonexistent `pnpm
bootstrap:status`/`pnpm bootstrap` commands, deferred by the
previous tick in favor of the `<PROJECT_PKG_PREFIX>` double-`@`
fix — over the AUDIT block's own `[A/E, 2.7]` and `[C/F, 1.6]`
rows, both lower-scoring. `plan/CRITIQUE.md`'s pending queue is
now three LOW/MED rows, no HIGH. Not a fresh A-G sweep; last
full sweep still the 2026-07-19 digest tick (above).

Cloud tick 2026-07-20 (third): #12 still the only blocked
AUDIT row. Re-scored `plan/CRITIQUE.md`'s remaining queue (one
LOW, two MED). The LOW row (`<PROJECT_PKG_PREFIX>` worked
example) reproduced as already resolved (prior tick pointed
`templates/README.md` at `playbooks/new-project.md` §4, which
covers the token) — left in Pending per iterate.md §5.4 (this
skill doesn't author CRITIQUE rows; a `/critique` pass
re-confirms and closes it). Of the two MED rows, both scored
about even; shipped the step-9 `setup/` missing-directory row
over the step-7 "uncomment the matching block" row — its
evidence showed a literal reproduced command failure (`cp:
... No such file or directory`, exit 1) versus step 7's softer
stale-guidance drift, and the fix was a single self-contained
paragraph. Both outscored the AUDIT block's own `[A/E, 2.7]`
and `[C/F, 1.6]` rows. Not a fresh A-G sweep; last full sweep
still the 2026-07-19 digest tick (above).

Cloud tick 2026-07-20 (fourth): #12 still the only blocked
AUDIT row. Shipped the remaining `plan/CRITIQUE.md` MED row —
`playbooks/new-project.md:455-456`'s stale "uncomment the
matching block" instruction, which no longer matches
`deploy-check.mjs`'s live `if (PROVIDER === ...)` branches
selected via `DEPLOY_PROVIDER` — scoring higher (impact 6,
ease 8) than the AUDIT block's own `[A/E, 2.7]` and `[C/F, 1.6]`
rows. The remaining CRITIQUE row (`<PROJECT_PKG_PREFIX>` worked
example, LOW) reproduced as already resolved in a prior tick;
left in Pending per iterate.md §5.4. Not a fresh A-G sweep;
last full sweep still the 2026-07-19 digest tick (above).

Cloud tick 2026-07-21: fresh A-G sweep (header 2 days old, past
iterate.md's 24h threshold). F (model-id freshness) and G
(sibling lessons) re-confirmed clean without a manual re-derive
— ids current, no `../kintilla`/`../semilayer`/`NEXUS_LESSONS.md`
in this checkout. A/B/C/D/E swept fresh: reproduced the
documented copy + placeholder-sweep flow in a scratch repo and
found the sweep's grep/`Get-ChildItem` scope (both one-liners,
`playbooks/new-project.md` §4) omits `./data` even though the
same section's preceding paragraph documents copying
`templates/data/` there for GitHub-as-DB adopters —
`templates/data/README.md` carries live `<PROJECT>`/
`<PROJECT_PKG_PREFIX>` tokens that survive the sweep as written.
Same bug class as two already-fixed CRITIQUE.md rows (`./scripts`,
`./.env.example` scope gaps). Also found `plan/CRITIQUE.md`'s one
pending row (`<PROJECT_PKG_PREFIX>` worked example) already
resolved by a prior tick — left in Pending per iterate.md §5.4.
Shipped the `./data` scope fix (below) over the AUDIT block's own
`[A/E, 2.7]` and `[C/F, 1.6]` rows (both scored lower) and three
new lower-scoring rows found this sweep, now queued to Pending:
`playbooks/existing-project.md`'s empty `plan/phases/` overlay
gap, `README.md:309`'s two unwrapped bullets, and
`playbooks/cloud-loop.md:66`'s stale "three new files" count.

Cloud tick 2026-07-22: fresh A-G sweep (header 1 day old, past
iterate.md's 24h threshold). F and G re-confirmed clean (model
ids current across the repo bar one exception below; no sibling
lessons files in this checkout). Found two new rows, both
scoring below this tick's pick: `playbooks/cloud-loop.md:62`
citing "Sonnet 4.6" where every other model-id reference in the
repo (`march.yml`, `customization/claude-code.md`) says
`claude-sonnet-5`, and `templates/skills/triage.md:137`
hardcoding `blob/main` in a GitHub link instead of
`blob/<DEFAULT_BRANCH>` like its sibling skill templates use.
#12 still the sole blocked row. Shipped the highest-scoring
open row — `[B, 4.5]` `existing-project.md`'s empty
`plan/phases/` gap — over both new rows (4.0 and 3.6) and the
three carried-over LOW/lower-MED rows.

Cloud tick 2026-07-23: #12 still the only blocked AUDIT row
(same `ACTIONS_PAT` scope constraint). Header still <24h old
(last full sweep 2026-07-22), so re-scored rather than
re-swept: this block's own highest scorer,
`[A/E, 4.0]` (triage.md's `blob/main`), tied `[F/A, 3.6]` and
the AUDIT block's other rows, but scored below
`plan/CRITIQUE.md`'s MED sed-backup-suffix row once ease was
weighed in (impact 6, ease 8 -> 4.8) — a reproduced, loud
breaking bug on a claimed-supported platform (stock macOS)
versus a cosmetic wrong-link edge case. Shipped that CRITIQUE
row instead; this block's rows are unchanged and still
Pending.

Cloud tick 2026-07-23 (second): #12 still the only blocked
AUDIT row, unchanged. Header still <24h old, so re-scored:
`[A/E, 4.0]` (triage.md's `blob/main`) is now this block's own
top scorer with no competing CRITIQUE HIGH/MED row pending
(both remaining CRITIQUE rows are LOW). Shipped it.

Cloud tick 2026-07-23 (third): #12 still the only blocked AUDIT
row, unchanged. Re-scored: `[F/A, 3.6]` (cloud-loop.md's stale
"Sonnet 4.6") is now this block's own top scorer, beating
`plan/CRITIQUE.md`'s two remaining LOW rows (~2.4 and ~2.1,
both cosmetic instruction-drift with cheap fixes but lower
impact than a wrong model-id reference on the kit's headline
$0-cost pitch) and the AUDIT block's other rows (2.7, 1.8,
1.6, 1.35). Shipped it.

Cloud tick 2026-07-23 (fourth): #12 still the only blocked AUDIT
row, unchanged. Header still <24h old, so re-scored rather than
re-swept: `plan/CRITIQUE.md`'s `./data`-scope LOW row tied this
block's own `[A/E, 2.7]` (README's "Files added" checklist).
Followed the established tie-break (favoring the queue — see
the 2026-07-19 (second) log line above) and shipped the
`./data` row: a reproduced loud shell error (`grep: ./data: No
such file or directory`, exit 2) on the documented one-liner
for the common no-data-layer case, versus a purely cosmetic doc
undercount. This block's rows are unchanged and still Pending.

Cloud tick 2026-07-24: header 2 days old, past the 24h
threshold, so ran a targeted fresh check rather than a full
manual A-G re-derive: F (model-id freshness, grepped the whole
tree for stale patterns) and G (sibling lessons — still absent)
confirmed clean/empty except one new hit. Found `templates/.github/CLOUD_LOOP.md`
still citing "Sonnet 4.6"/"Opus 4.7" in two sections (the cost
table and "Upgrading the model") — the exact bug class fixed in
`playbooks/cloud-loop.md:62` two ticks ago (2026-07-23 third),
but that fix only touched the internal playbook copy and missed
this template counterpart, which is the one adopters actually
receive (`AGENTS.md` rule 7: templates are the product).
Shipped it over `plan/CRITIQUE.md`'s sole remaining LOW row
(`.claude/` prune-list gap) and this block's own carried-over
rows (2.7, 1.8, 1.6, 1.35) — higher impact (adopter-facing
template, not internal docs) at similar ease (four line edits).
Not a full A-G sweep; A/B/C/D/E leaned on prior sweeps and
`verify.mjs`'s green tree/link/emoji legs.

Cloud tick 2026-07-24 (second): #12 still the only blocked AUDIT
row. Header 2 days old (last full sweep 2026-07-22); ran a
targeted fresh check instead of a full re-derive: F (grepped the
whole tree for stale model-id patterns — the only hits left are
historical prose in `plan/AUDIT.md`/`plan/DIGEST.md`, no live
docs) and G (sibling lessons dirs still absent from this
checkout) both confirmed clean/empty. `plan/CRITIQUE.md`'s sole
remaining LOW row (`.claude/` prune-list gap) tied this block's
own `[A/E, 2.7]` row exactly (impact 3, ease 9). Followed the
established tie-break (favor the queue — see the 2026-07-19
(second) and 2026-07-23 (fourth) log lines above) and shipped
the CRITIQUE row. `plan/CRITIQUE.md`'s pending queue is now
empty. Not a full A-G sweep; A/B/C/D leaned on prior sweeps and
`verify.mjs`'s green tree.

Digest tick 2026-07-24: header was 2 days old, past
`skills/digest.md` §3's 48h staleness threshold, so ran a full
A-G sweep (dispatched to a dedicated audit agent; verify.mjs's
green links/tree/emoji legs covered the mechanical half).
Spot-checked all 4 non-durable Pending rows below — all still
reproduce. Sharpened two: `[C/F, 1.6]` now cites a live `curl`
200 confirming the fictional URL resolves to a real unrelated
site, not just a parked domain; `[A, 1.35]` now has a settled
`next` — `git log --follow -p` on `cloud-loop.md` shows the
"Three new files" header and its 2-entry tree have coexisted
since the doc's first commit, so the fix is correcting the
count to "Two," not restoring a lost file. Widened `[D, 1.8]`'s
evidence to include a third unwrapped bullet at `README.md:324`
found during the same pass. Added three new findings: `[A,
4.8]` (highest score this sweep) — `customization/claude-code.md:310`
teaches the `claude_args: {"model": "..."}` JSON form as the
Cloud-loop model-routing lever, but `.github/workflows/march.yml`
(both nexus's own and the `templates/` mirror) documents from a
real incident that this JSON form silently drops
`permissionMode`, and ships the CLI-flag string form instead —
an adopter following the customization doc's table literally
reintroduces the exact bug the kit already paid to discover;
`[A, 2.4]` — README's own collapsed `skills/` tree
(`README.md:510-511`) omits `skills/digest.md`, even though it
exists on disk and `templates/README.md:41` lists its templated
twin correctly; `[A, 1.6]` — `plan/steps/01_build_plan.md`'s
"Carry-overs" section cites stale queue counts (AUDIT "seeded
with 9" vs. today's 5 Pending rows; PHASE_CANDIDATES.md "holds
4 candidates" vs. today's 20). C (external links, beyond
verify.mjs's relative-link leg), F (model ids), and G (sibling
lessons, still absent) swept clean otherwise. Audit only —
shipped nothing, per digest.md rule 2.

Cloud tick 2026-07-25: #12 still the only blocked AUDIT row.
Header <24h old (last full sweep 2026-07-24 digest tick), so
re-scored rather than re-swept: `plan/CRITIQUE.md`'s Pending
queue is empty (no competing row), so shipped this block's own
top scorer — `[A/E, 2.7]` (README's "Files added" checklist
undersells `scripts/`) — over the four remaining lower-scoring
rows (2.4, 1.8, 1.6, 1.6, 1.35).

Cloud tick 2026-07-25 (second): #12 still the only blocked
AUDIT row (same `workflows`-scope constraint). `[A/E, 2.7]`
now shipped, so this tick took the new top scorer —
`[A, 2.4]` (README's collapsed `skills/` tree omits
`skills/digest.md`) — over the three remaining rows (1.8, 1.6,
1.6, 1.35).

Cloud tick 2026-07-25 (third): #12 still the only blocked AUDIT
row. Header was 27h old (past the 24h threshold), so ran a
targeted fresh check instead of a full manual re-derive: F
(grepped the whole tree for stale model-id patterns — only
historical prose hits in this file and `plan/DIGEST.md`, no
live docs) and G (sibling lessons dirs still absent from this
checkout) both confirmed clean/empty; verify.mjs green
(links/tree/discover/placeholders/anatomy/emoji). Reproduced all
four non-durable Pending rows below — all still current, none
resolved. Shipped this block's own top scorer, `[D, 1.8]`
(README.md's three unwrapped bullets) — `plan/CRITIQUE.md`'s
queue is empty, so no competing row. Not a full A-G sweep; A/B/C/E
leaned on the reproduction pass above and verify.mjs's green
tree.

Cloud tick 2026-07-26: header 2 days old; ran a targeted fresh
check rather than a full manual re-derive: F (grepped the whole
tree for stale model-id patterns — none live), G (sibling
lessons dirs still absent from this checkout) both confirmed
clean/empty; verify.mjs green. Reproduced all three non-blocked
Pending rows below — all still current. `plan/CRITIQUE.md`'s
sole Pending row (LOW, "GitHub-as-DB" unglossed in README's
`/ship-data` row) scored ~2.7 (impact 3, ease 9 — a one-clause
addition), beating this block's own top row (`[A, 1.6]` at 1.6).
Shipped the CRITIQUE row instead.

Digest tick 2026-07-27: header was 3 days old (last full sweep
the 2026-07-24 digest tick), past `skills/digest.md`'s 48h
threshold, so ran a full A-G sweep. Reproduced all three
non-blocked Pending rows below byte-for-byte: `[C/F, 1.6]`
(`ember.vercel.app`) and `[A, 1.35]` ("three new files") are
unchanged; `[A, 1.6]`'s own cited counts had gone stale a
second time since it was last written (it said "5 Pending" /
"20 candidates" — yesterday's digest already flagged this drift
in prose but never edited the row — today's actuals are 4
Pending and 21 candidates), evidence sharpened below.
`plan/CRITIQUE.md`'s Pending queue confirmed empty (all rows
closed as of `34fe6d1`). F: grepped the whole tree for stale
model-id patterns — none live, every hit is
`claude-sonnet-5`/`claude-opus-4-8`/`claude-haiku-4-5`. G:
`../kintilla`, `../semilayer`, and any `NEXUS_LESSONS.md` still
absent from this checkout — dimension checked, not skipped, per
this task's instructions. C: curled every non-vendor external
URL in the tree (`thock.xyz`, `github.com/daretodave/thock`
both 200; `ember.vercel.app` 200, already tracked as `[C/F,
1.6]`; `thock.netlify.app` only survives in this file's own
historical log prose, not live docs) — no new rot. D: leaned on
verify.mjs's green emoji leg plus a manual heading-case and
title-case spot-check across README/playbooks/customization —
no new hits. E: reconfirmed README's command table lists all 15
`templates/claude/commands/` files with correct rows,
`/lessons-pr` correctly excluded (no template counterpart, per
the 2026-07-19 (third) log line above). B: no new
promised-but-missing files found. Found one new row: `[C, 3.6]`
— `scripts/verify.mjs`'s `REVERSE_CHECK_DIRS` array omits
`templates/plan`, the exact directory whose disk/doc mismatch
(`PHASE_CANDIDATES.md` + `CURRENT-STATE.md` missing from
README's kit tree) an earlier tick had to catch by hand
(2026-07-19 digest, `[A/C, 3.2]` in Done below) because the gate
had no reverse-check there. Tested locally: adding
`'templates/plan'` to the array and re-running
`node scripts/verify.mjs` passes clean (35 files
reverse-checked, up from 24, zero new failures) — the
"adopt-by-need annotations would need new handling" concern
noted when that Done-row gap was first spotted no longer holds;
`templates/README.md`'s `plan/` tree block already uses the same
`(omit unless ...)` comment style the other four reverse-checked
dirs use, which the parser already handles. Reverted the local
probe edit before writing this file (verified `git diff
scripts/verify.mjs` clean). Scores above this block's three
carried-over rows (3.6 vs. 1.6 / 1.6 / 1.35); `#12` stays the
durable top row of Pending, still blocked on the same
`workflows`-scope constraint (`ACTIONS_PAT` has no `workflows`
scope). Audit only — shipped nothing, per `skills/digest.md`
rule 2.

Cloud tick 2026-07-28: header <24h old (last full sweep the
2026-07-27 digest tick), so re-scored rather than re-swept:
`plan/CRITIQUE.md`'s Pending queue confirmed empty. #12 stays
the durable blocked row (same `workflows`-scope constraint).
Shipped this block's own top scorer, `[C, 3.6]`
(`scripts/verify.mjs`'s `REVERSE_CHECK_DIRS` omitting
`templates/plan`) — over the three remaining lower-scoring
rows (1.6, 1.6, 1.35).

Cloud tick 2026-07-28 (second): header now 27h old (past the
24h threshold), so ran a targeted fresh check rather than a
full manual re-derive: F (grepped the whole tree for stale
model-id patterns — none live) and G (sibling lessons dirs
still absent from this checkout) both confirmed clean/empty;
verify.mjs green (links/tree/discover/placeholders/anatomy/
emoji, 35 files reverse-checked). `plan/CRITIQUE.md`'s Pending
queue confirmed empty. Reproduced all three non-blocked
Pending rows below — all still current, including `[A, 1.6]`'s
own point: its cited counts ("9"/"4") have drifted again since
last written (today's actuals are 4 AUDIT Pending rows, 21
PHASE_CANDIDATES Pending rows). `[A, 1.6]` and `[C/F, 1.6]`
tied on score; shipped `[A, 1.6]` over `[C/F, 1.6]` and
`[A, 1.35]` — its fix removes the hardcoded counts entirely
(points at the live files instead), so this exact row can't
recur, where `[C/F, 1.6]`'s fix only swaps one string that
could drift again the same way. Not a full A-G sweep; A/B/D/E
leaned on verify.mjs's green tree and prior sweeps.

Cloud tick 2026-07-29: header now >24h old, ran a fresh A-G
sweep (delegated the read-only pass to an agent to protect
context, then verified its top candidate by hand before
shipping). B/C/D/E/F re-confirmed clean (templates/ vs. both
tree diagrams match exactly disk-for-disk both directions;
skills/*.md path references all resolve; voice/wrap sampling
on recently-touched docs clean; model ids all carry the
standing caveat, none stale). G still empty — no sibling
lessons dirs present in this checkout. New A finding: README's
own "What's in this kit" tree lists `AGENTS.md` then jumps
straight to `package.json`, skipping root `CLAUDE.md` — a real
file (`ls` confirms) that's load-bearing (Claude Code only
auto-loads `CLAUDE.md` from repo root, not `.claude/`) and
already named explicitly in this same doc's "Files added"
line 170. `templates/README.md`'s own tree already lists the
templated twin (`claude/CLAUDE.md`) — this was the one root
substrate file the kit's own tree of itself omitted. Scored
[A, 4.5] (impact 5, ease 9) — beats all three standing Pending
rows below, so shipped it this tick instead. Re-verified the
three standing Pending rows are all still current (still
blocked / still accurate); not re-derived from scratch.

Cloud tick 2026-07-29 (second): header <24h old (last full sweep
this same day's first tick, above), so no re-sweep. Neither of
this block's own two Pending rows (`[C/F, 1.6]`, `[A, 1.35]`)
outscored `plan/CRITIQUE.md`'s pending queue, which had one LOW
row not yet re-scored by this file's log:
`concepts/skills-anatomy.md:121`'s "canonical 12 steps" undercount
(impact 3, ease 9 -> 2.7, cheapest and clearest of the three —
reproduced, one-word fix). Mirrored as issue #29 and shipped;
`plan/CRITIQUE.md`'s Pending queue is now empty again. #12 stays
the durable blocked row. This block's own two rows are unchanged
and still Pending.

Cloud tick 2026-07-29 (third): header still <24h old (last full
sweep this same day's first tick, above), so no re-sweep.
`plan/CRITIQUE.md`'s Pending queue confirmed empty. Reproduced
this block's own top scorer, `[C/F, 1.6]` — `curl` unnecessary,
the domain match at `templates/skills/bootstrap.md:217` still
reads `https://ember.vercel.app` — and shipped it over `[A, 1.35]`
(lower score). #12 stays the durable blocked row.

Cloud tick 2026-07-30: header was ~24h old (last edit
2026-07-29T14:49Z), at the staleness threshold, so ran a fresh
A-G sweep (delegated the read-only pass to an agent to protect
context, then verified the top candidate by hand before
shipping). `node scripts/verify.mjs` green throughout. F (model
ids — only `claude-sonnet-5`/`claude-opus-4-8`/`claude-haiku-4-5`
appear, all correctly captioned) and G (sibling lessons — still
absent from this checkout) both clean/empty. Re-verified `[A,
1.35]` (cloud-loop.md's "three new files" header) still
reproduces unchanged. Found seven new rows, ranked below;
top scorer `[B/E, 6.3]` shipped this tick (below) — a real
functional gap, not cosmetic: `playbooks/existing-project.md`'s
brownfield overlay copied only `templates/scripts/deploy-check.mjs`
where `playbooks/new-project.md` copies the whole `templates/scripts/`
directory, so brownfield adopters silently missed
`loop-issue.mjs`, `notify.mjs`, `bootstrap.mjs`,
`lint-migration.mjs`, `stack-lifecycle.mjs`,
`refresh-critique-session.mjs`, and `check-secrets-liveness.mjs`
— scripts the bulk-copied `templates/skills/` and
`templates/claude/settings.json` (Bash allowlist) already assume
exist. Reproduced in a scratch dir before fixing. The remaining
six new rows are queued to Pending, all lower-scoring:
`[A, 5.4]` (skills-anatomy.md's stale "seven (or eight) skills"
count vs. 15 shipped), `[C, 4.0]` (iterate.md's `ship-data.md §6`
citation should be `§7`), `[D, 3.6]` (three docs' H1s missing
their sibling family's `# Playbook:`/`# Customization:` prefix),
`[A, 2.7]` (three docs describe/quote `templates/claude/CLAUDE.md`
as its old, shorter form), `[C, 2.4]` (two docs cite
`skills/digest.md §4` for content that's actually in `§3` item 4),
and `[A, 2.4]` (`templates/plan/README.md`'s layout tree omits
`CURRENT-STATE.md`).

Cloud tick 2026-07-30 (second): header <24h old (last full sweep
this same day's first tick, above), so no re-sweep.
`plan/CRITIQUE.md`'s Pending queue confirmed empty. Reproduced
this block's own top scorer, `[A, 5.4]` — `concepts/skills-anatomy.md:374`
still reads "seven (or eight)" against 15 files actually shipped
in `templates/skills/` — and shipped it over the five remaining
lower-scoring rows (4.0, 3.6, 2.7, 2.4, 2.4). #12 stays the
durable blocked row.

Cloud tick 2026-07-31: header <24h old (last full sweep
2026-07-30's first tick, above), so no re-sweep.
`plan/CRITIQUE.md`'s Pending queue confirmed empty. Shipped
this block's own top scorer, `[C, 4.0]` (`templates/skills/iterate.md`'s
wrong `ship-data.md` section citation) — over the four
remaining lower-scoring rows (3.6, 2.7, 2.4, 2.4). #12 stays
the durable blocked row.

Cloud tick 2026-07-31 (second): header still <24h old (last full
sweep 2026-07-30's first tick, above — now ~24h old but under
the threshold), so no re-sweep. `plan/CRITIQUE.md`'s Pending
queue confirmed empty. Reproduced this block's own top scorer,
`[A, 2.7]` (three docs describe/quote the old, shorter
`templates/claude/CLAUDE.md`) — confirmed the file is 8 lines/2
paragraphs while `README.md:556` and `templates/README.md:44`
both still said "two-line pointer," and
`customization/claude-code.md:287-294` quoted a stale 3-line
block missing the build-plan-pointer line and the second
paragraph — and shipped it over the two remaining rows
(`[C, 2.4]`, `[A, 2.4]`, both lower-scoring) and `[A, 1.35]`.
#12 stays the durable blocked row.

Cloud tick 2026-07-31 (third): header still <24h old (last full
sweep 2026-07-30's first tick, above), so no re-sweep.
`plan/CRITIQUE.md`'s Pending queue confirmed empty. Two rows
tied at the top, `[C, 2.4]` and `[A, 2.4]`; picked the
adopter-facing one per `bearings.md` decision 1 —
`templates/plan/README.md` ships to every adopter, `plan/DIGEST.md`
/ `plan/PHASE_CANDIDATES.md` are kit-internal — and shipped
`[A, 2.4]` (`templates/plan/README.md`'s layout tree omits
`CURRENT-STATE.md`) over `[C, 2.4]` and `[A, 1.35]`. #12 stays
the durable blocked row.

Cloud tick 2026-08-02: header 3 days old (last full sweep
2026-07-30's first tick, above), past the ~24-72h threshold this
log has used elsewhere, so ran a fresh A-G sweep (delegated the
read-only pass to an agent to protect context). `/march` routed
here via `/iterate` (no pending build-plan phase, critique gate
not due, expand gate already ran this same tick's earlier pass).
Top of queue was `[user-issue #12]` (4.0) but it stays blocked —
`ACTIONS_PAT` still lacks `workflows` scope, confirmed durable
per its own row. Picked the next-highest actionable row instead:
`[user-issue #33]` (3.5) — verified `.claude/hooks/guard.mjs`'s
four `RULES` entries all used `[^|;&]*`, a JS regex negated
class that (unlike `.`) matches newlines, letting the pattern
span logical Bash command boundaries; reproduced live (a
multi-line test command false-blocked as `no-verify` while I was
composing the reproduction case for this very row) before
shipping the fix. F (model ids — only `sonnet-5`/`opus-4-8`/
`haiku-4-5`, all hedged "ids age — check `/model`") and G
(sibling lessons — still absent from this checkout) both
clean/empty. Re-verified `[A, 1.35]` and `[C, 2.4]` still
reproduce unchanged. Found one new row, queued to Pending below
the existing two: `[C, 2.4]` (`templates/skills/triage.md`'s
follow-up-comment citation half-points at `ship-data.md` §6,
which has zero matching content). #12 stays the durable blocked
row.

Digest tick 2026-08-25: header was 23 days old (last full sweep
2026-08-02, above) — far past the 48h refresh threshold
`skills/digest.md` §3 step 5 sets, so ran a fresh A-G sweep
(delegated the read-only pass to an agent to protect context;
`/digest` never ships, so audit-only). `[user-issue #35]` (opened
2026-08-23, cloud push token still lacks `workflows` scope)
confirmed still the durable blocked row — unchanged, untouched.
Re-verified the three open rows from the 2026-08-02 sweep: all
three still reproduce unchanged in substance (only line numbers
drifted, from intervening phases 21-22 growing the cited files) —
`[A, 1.35]` (`playbooks/cloud-loop.md` "three new files" header,
now line 67), `[C, 2.4]` (digest.md §4 mis-citation, now
`plan/DIGEST.md:109` / `plan/PHASE_CANDIDATES.md:533`), `[C, 2.4]`
(triage.md's dead `ship-data.md §6` citation, unchanged at
`templates/skills/triage.md:217-218`). F swept clean except one
new row below; G still empty (no sibling lessons file in this
checkout). Phases 21 (`prompts/`) and 22
(`playbooks/workspace.md`) — the two newest, least-audited
surfaces — checked clean: placeholder table, time estimates,
cross-links, and external links all verified. New row queued:
`[F, 3.6]` — `templates/.github/CLOUD_LOOP.md` hedges "Sonnet 5"
mentions with "(ids age — check `/model`)" but leaves the
adjacent "Opus 4.8" mentions in the same two spots unhedged,
same bug class as two prior Done rows in this file. Per digest's
own rail (`skills/digest.md` §4.2): audit refreshed, nothing
shipped — this is a proposal-and-record tick only.

Digest tick 2026-08-27: header was 51h old (last full sweep the
2026-08-25 digest tick, above), past the 48h threshold, so ran a
fresh A-G sweep (delegated the read-only pass to an agent to
protect context; `/digest` never ships, so audit-only). Both
durable rows confirmed still open and blocked via `gh issue
view`: `[user-issue #40]` and `[user-issue #35]`, unchanged.
Reproduced all four non-durable Pending rows: three unchanged —
`[F, 3.6]` (CLOUD_LOOP.md's Opus-4.8 hedge gap, same lines
34-36/230-232), `[C, 2.4]` (triage.md's dead `ship-data.md §6`
citation, unchanged at lines 217-218), `[A, 1.35]`
(cloud-loop.md's "three new files" header, unchanged at line
67) — and one half-resolved: `plan/DIGEST.md:107`'s half of the
`skills/digest.md §4` mis-citation was already fixed by an
intervening tick (now correctly reads "§3 step 4"), narrowing
the row to `plan/PHASE_CANDIDATES.md:533` alone and re-scoring
it `[C, 2.7]` (impact 3, ease 9 — a single-line reword, cheaper
than the two-file fix it replaces). A-F swept fresh: verify.mjs
green throughout (including `adopt-dryrun.mjs`'s mechanized
check, 56 files swept, 0 unresolved tokens); every non-vendor
external URL in the tree curled 200; README's 15-row command
table cross-checked 1:1 against `templates/claude/commands/`;
both bash/PowerShell placeholder-sweep scopes in
`playbooks/new-project.md` identical (8 tokens × 8 paths each);
whole-repo model-id grep clean bar the standing CLOUD_LOOP hedge
gap above; phases 24-25's newest surfaces
(`scripts/pulse.mjs`, `scripts/adopt-dryrun.mjs`) checked clean
on doc/tree/wiring cross-references. G still empty — no sibling
lessons files (`../kintilla`, `NEXUS_LESSONS.md`) present in
this checkout. No new findings beyond the four rows above — a
genuine clean sweep, not an incomplete pass. Audit only —
shipped nothing, per `skills/digest.md` rule 2.

Cloud tick 2026-09-01: `plan/CRITIQUE.md`'s Pending queue held
one HIGH row (score well above every AUDIT row here, including
the two 4×2/10=0.8 blocked user-issues and the 3.6-scoring `[F]`
row) — the "AskUserQuestion only in /oversight" hard rule
contradicting `templates/skills/bootstrap.md`'s own documented
carve-out. Shipped it: reworded the absolute claim to
"`/oversight` and `/bootstrap`" everywhere it appeared (13
files total, both this repo's own docs and their `templates/`
twins — `templates/` is public API per `AGENTS.md` rule 7, so
its copies needed the identical fix, not just the kit's own
docs). Full rationale and file list in `plan/CRITIQUE.md`'s
Done section. AUDIT block otherwise unchanged; four Pending
rows below not re-verified this tick (queue row took priority
per `skills/iterate.md` §3's shared scoring scale).

Digest tick 2026-09-01: header was 5 days old (last full sweep
the 2026-08-27 digest tick, above), well past the 48h
threshold, so ran a fresh A-G sweep (delegated the read-only
pass to a foreground agent to protect context — `run_in_background:
false` explicitly, since this is a cloud tick and a backgrounded
agent's result would never land before the job exits; see the
`[promoted → phase 20]` candidate in `plan/PHASE_CANDIDATES.md`
this exact trap is scored against). All three durable rows
(`[user-issue #40]`, `[user-issue #35]`, `[user-issue #49]`) still
open — same cloud-push-token workflows-scope gap, unchanged.
Reproduced all five non-durable Pending rows: unchanged in
substance, two with line drift from intervening commits —
`[F, 3.6]` (CLOUD_LOOP.md's Opus-4.8 hedge gap, still lines
33-36/228-232), `[C, 2.7]` (PHASE_CANDIDATES.md's digest.md §4
mis-citation, now line 591), `[C, 2.4]` (triage.md's dead
`ship-data.md §6` citation, now lines 222-223), `[A, 2.4]`
(guard.mjs template drift, unchanged). One new row found and
queued: `[A, 3.2]` — README.md's "What's in this kit" templates
tree (lines 441-501) never picked up `templates/workspace/`,
the 4-file adopt-by-need family phase 33 shipped the same day;
`templates/README.md`'s own tree and README's playbooks section
both already list it correctly, only the templates-tree mirror
missed it — same bug class as this file's prior
PHASE_CANDIDATES/CURRENT-STATE Done row. Six non-durable
candidates now compete for five Top-5 slots; `[A, 1.35]`
(cloud-loop.md's "three new files" header) is still genuinely
valid but the lowest scorer, so it drops from the tracked Top 5
this rewrite — re-discoverable on a future sweep if it's still
open then. A-F otherwise swept clean: verify.mjs green across
all seven legs; no stale model-id strings anywhere in the tree;
external links all resolved; README's placeholder table and
command table both checked 1:1 against disk. G still empty — no
sibling lessons files present in this checkout. `plan/CRITIQUE.md`'s
Pending queue holds 4 LOW dry-run rows not folded into this
file (separate queue, same scoring scale, left for whoever ships
next). Audit only — shipped nothing, per `skills/digest.md` rule 2.

## Pending

### [user-issue #40] [MED] apply phase 23's crash-alarm patch to nexus's own march.yml + night.yml by hand
- category: external-issue
- impact: 4, ease: 2
- evidence: a phase-23 cloud tick landed the durable-alarm fix
  (GITHUB_TOKEN instead of ACTIONS_PAT for the crash-alarm step,
  plus named failed-step reporting) in
  `templates/.github/workflows/march.yml` and `night.yml`
  (commit `8dc2080`) but could not apply the identical patch to
  this repo's own `.github/workflows/march.yml` / `night.yml`:
  the push was rejected because that tick's git credential was
  the Claude Code Action's own GitHub App installation token, not
  `ACTIONS_PAT`, and GitHub refuses non-`workflows`-scoped tokens
  touching top-level `.github/workflows/*.yml`. This directly
  confirms root-cause (a) in `[user-issue #35]`'s evidence below
  (the Action overwrites the checkout-configured credential with
  its own App token before the agent's turn starts) — same
  blocked class, not yet root-caused to a fix, just newly
  evidenced. The issue body carries a ready-to-apply unified diff
  for both files plus a matching `.github/CLOUD_LOOP.md` doc
  update.
- next: same resolution pattern as the now-closed
  `[user-issue #12]` — apply from a local/human `/oversight`
  session (`git apply` the diff in issue #40, or hand-edit to
  match), run `node scripts/verify.mjs`, then push directly (a
  human push carries normal repo-write permissions, not the App
  token's workflow restriction). Closes #40 when done.

### [user-issue #35] [MED] cloud push token still lacks workflows scope despite the 2026-08-23 re-mint
- category: external-issue
- impact: 4, ease: 2
- evidence: phase 20's cloud ship attempt (run 32663251226,
  2026-08-23) built and verified all three deliverables, then
  `git push` was rejected: "refusing to allow a GitHub App to
  create or update workflow `.github/workflows/march.yml`
  without `workflows` permission." `gh auth status` in that run
  reported `claude[bot]` (the Claude Code Action's own GitHub
  App installation token), not the `ACTIONS_PAT` secret — even
  though `march.yml`'s `Run /march` step sets
  `GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.ACTIONS_PAT }}` explicitly and the
  checkout step sets `token: ${{ secrets.ACTIONS_PAT }}`.
  Non-workflow-file pushes on the same run (this issue's mirror,
  #34, and the phase-20-blocked commit itself) succeeded fine,
  isolating the gap to `.github/workflows/*.yml` writes only —
  consistent with either (a) the Claude Code Action overwriting
  the checkout-configured git credentials with its own App
  token before the agent's turn starts, or (b) `ACTIONS_PAT`
  not actually carrying `workflows` scope despite the re-mint
  note in `AGENTS.md`.
- next: needs a local session to inspect the actual `ACTIONS_PAT`
  scope grants in GitHub's token settings UI and to test whether
  a plain `git push` (bypassing `gh`/the Action's credential
  helper) succeeds against `.github/workflows/*.yml` with that
  token. Same class of environment constraint that blocked
  #12 pre-rescope — cannot be root-caused further from inside a
  cloud tick, since any cloud tick reproduces the same
  credential wiring. Phase 20 stays `[blocked: cloud push token
  lacks workflows scope 2026-08-23]` until this resolves.

### [user-issue #49] [MED] phase 32 blocked — same cloud push token workflows-scope gap as #35/#40
- category: external-issue
- impact: 4, ease: 2
- evidence: phase 32's cloud ship attempt (2026-08-30) built and
  verified `.github/workflows/heartbeat.yml` and
  `templates/.github/workflows/heartbeat.yml` changes in full,
  then `git push` was rejected for the same reason as #35/#40:
  "refusing to allow a GitHub App to create or update workflow
  `.github/workflows/heartbeat.yml` without `workflows`
  permission." `git remote -v` in that run showed the GitHub App
  installation token (`ghs_...`) authenticating git push, not
  `ACTIONS_PAT` — third confirmed occurrence of the same root
  cause (phase 20, #40, now phase 32). The diff was built and
  verified green then discarded per AGENTS.md rule 1 (no dirty
  tree at turn end) rather than left half-committed; full brief
  at `plan/phases/phase_32_scheduled_workflow_disable_watch.md`.
- next: same resolution as #35/#40 — a local/human session runs
  `/ship-a-phase` (or hand-applies the brief) for phase 32,
  pushing with normal repo-write credentials instead of the
  cloud tick's App token. Closes #49 when done; also flips phase
  32 from `[blocked: ...]` to `[x]` in
  `plan/steps/01_build_plan.md`.

### [F, 3.6] CLOUD_LOOP.md hedges "Sonnet 5" mentions but not the adjacent "Opus 4.8" ones
- category: freshness
- impact: 4, ease: 9
- evidence: `templates/.github/CLOUD_LOOP.md` pairs a Sonnet-5
  line with the standing "(ids age — check `/model`)" hedge in
  two spots but leaves the very next Opus-4.8 line unhedged in
  both: the cost table at lines 34-36 (line 35 hedges Sonnet 5,
  line 36's Opus 4.8 row does not), and the "Upgrading the
  model" section at lines 230-232 (the hedge is grammatically
  attached only to "Sonnet 5"; "To upgrade to Opus 4.8:" on the
  next line is bare). The ids are currently correct — this is
  the hedging convention applied inconsistently within the same
  doc, same bug class as this file's two prior Done rows for
  stale "Sonnet 4.6"/"Opus 4.7" strings.
- next: add "(ids age — check `/model`)" to the Opus-4.8 line in
  the cost table (line 36) and to the "Opus 4.8" reference in
  "Upgrading the model" (line 232).

### [A, 3.2] README.md's kit tree omits templates/workspace/
- category: doc-drift
- impact: 4, ease: 8
- evidence: README.md's "What's in this kit" templates block
  (lines 441-501) has zero mentions of `workspace` — `grep -n
  workspace README.md` confirms — despite phase 33 shipping the
  4-file `templates/workspace/` adopt-by-need family (`CLAUDE.md`,
  `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, `REPOS.md`) the same day.
  `templates/README.md`'s own tree already lists it correctly
  (collapsed, line 84), and README's playbooks section already
  lists `workspace.md` — only the templates-tree mirror missed
  it. `scripts/verify.mjs`'s tree leg stays green because both
  diagrams collapse the directory rather than expanding it
  per-file, so the gate can't catch a missing top-level line.
  Same bug class as this file's prior PHASE_CANDIDATES/
  CURRENT-STATE Done row (a new top-level family lands without
  its README mirror).
- next: add one collapsed tree line for `templates/workspace/`
  to README.md's kit-tree block, matching
  `templates/README.md:84`'s phrasing.

### [C, 2.7] plan/PHASE_CANDIDATES.md still cites skills/digest.md §4 for content that's in §3
- category: link-hygiene
- impact: 3, ease: 9
- evidence: `plan/PHASE_CANDIDATES.md:591` (drifted from :533 as
  intervening candidates were appended) cites `skills/digest.md
  §4` for "mistuned gate / starved queue / tuning trigger"
  language, but `digest.md`'s `## 4. Hard rules` heading doesn't
  contain that content — it's item 4 inside `## 3. The
  procedure`. `plan/DIGEST.md:107` carried the identical bug
  until an intervening tick fixed it (now correctly reads "§3
  step 4"), narrowing this row to the one remaining file.
- next: reword `plan/PHASE_CANDIDATES.md:591` to "§3 step 4",
  matching `plan/DIGEST.md:107`'s already-fixed phrasing.

### [C, 2.4] triage.md's follow-up-comment citation points half at unrelated content
- category: link-hygiene
- impact: 3, ease: 8
- evidence: `templates/skills/triage.md:222-223` (drifted from
  217-218) says the `gh issue comment`/`gh issue close`
  follow-up procedure "is documented in `skills/iterate.md` §5
  and `skills/ship-data.md` §6." Verified `iterate.md` §5 (Step
  5-7) does cover the `Closes #N` trailer and close-comment
  flow, but `templates/skills/ship-data.md` §6 ("The procedure")
  is a generic data-entity CRUD walkthrough — grepped the whole
  file for "trailer", "Closes", "commit body", "issue": zero
  hits. The citation doesn't just point at the wrong section, it
  points at a file with no matching content anywhere.
- next: drop the `skills/ship-data.md §6` half of the citation in
  `triage.md:222-223` (or repoint it if the convention is
  documented somewhere in that file under a different heading —
  confirmed it currently is not).

### [A, 2.4] `templates/claude/hooks/guard.mjs` drifted from `.claude/hooks/guard.mjs`'s own hardening
- category: doc-drift
- impact: 3, ease: 8
- evidence: phase 28 (this commit's sibling) found the two
  files' `RULES` regexes differ: the kit's own copy uses
  `[^|;&\n]*` (excludes newlines from the "rest of command"
  character class, so a rule can't false-match across a
  multi-line Bash call), the template twin still uses
  `[^|;&]*` (no `\n` exclusion). The kit's `self-test` also
  carries a regression case for exactly this
  (`git log --oneline -5\necho "we will commit this later"\nls
  -n` → `null`) that the template's `self-test` doesn't have.
  Unclear which commit introduced the gap; both files otherwise
  stayed in lockstep through this phase's edits.
- next: port the `\n`-exclusion to all four regex-bearing rules
  in `templates/claude/hooks/guard.mjs` (`no-verify`,
  `force-push`, `destructive-reset`, `trailer-or-emoji-in-commit`)
  and add the matching multi-line self-test case; run both
  files' `self-test` after to confirm parity.

## Done

### [x] [user-issue #12] [MED] nexus's own march.yml needs phase 17's weighted-ceiling patch applied by hand — this commit (closes #12)
- fix: applied exactly as the row's `next` prescribed, from the
  2026-08-23 local `/oversight` session (Q2 authorized it —
  this was the human-credentialed session the row waited 7
  weeks for; the session's own pushes to `.github/workflows/`
  confirmed the local credential clears the `workflows`-scope
  wall `ACTIONS_PAT` cannot). Replaced the flat `Daily commit
  ceiling check` step in `.github/workflows/march.yml` with the
  weighted version from `templates/.github/workflows/march.yml`
  (phase=3 / churn=1, minus the bootstrap.local.json comment
  block — nexus has none), keeping `ceiling=8`, and aligned
  `.github/CLOUD_LOOP.md`'s "Daily operation" -> Ceiling bullet
  with the template's "The daily ceiling" section.

### [x] [user-issue #33] [MED] guard.mjs's no-verify regex false-positives across unrelated multi-line bash text — this commit (closes #33)
- fix: all four `RULES` entries in `.claude/hooks/guard.mjs`
  used `[^|;&]*`, a negated character class that (unlike `.`)
  matches newlines in JS regex, letting the pattern span
  logical command boundaries in a multi-line Bash string.
  Reproduced live: a command with `git log` on one line, an
  unrelated `echo "...commit..."` on a second, and an unrelated
  `-n` flag on a third false-blocked as `no-verify` with no
  actual `git commit --no-verify` anywhere — this happened
  organically while verifying the finding. Changed `[^|;&]*` to
  `[^|;&\n]*` (`\\n` inside the one template-literal rule) across
  all 8 occurrences in the 4 rules, and added the reproducing
  case to `selfTest()`'s cases array so it can't regress
  silently. `node .claude/hooks/guard.mjs self-test` green.

### [x] [A, 2.4] templates/plan/README.md's layout tree omits CURRENT-STATE.md — this commit
- fix: added a `CURRENT-STATE.md` row to the Layout tree in
  `templates/plan/README.md`, annotated "adopt-by-need:
  brownfield retrofit only" to match how `templates/README.md`
  and `playbooks/existing-project.md` already describe it.

### [x] [A, 2.7] three docs describe/quote the old, shorter templates/claude/CLAUDE.md — this commit
- fix: reworded the tree-comment labels in `README.md:556` and
  `templates/README.md:44` from "two-line pointer" to "short
  pointer" (non-numeric, can't drift again), and refreshed
  `customization/claude-code.md`'s quoted block to match
  `templates/claude/CLAUDE.md` verbatim — added the missing
  build-plan-pointer line and the second "pointer, not a rule
  book" paragraph.

### [x] [D, 3.6] three doc H1s are missing their sibling family's prefix — this commit
- fix: `playbooks/cloud-loop.md:1` now reads `# Playbook: cloud
  loop (opt-in) — run /march on GitHub Actions`;
  `customization/auth-aware-critique.md:1` now reads
  `# Customization: auth-aware critique`;
  `customization/branding.md:1` now reads `# Customization:
  branding & assets — the demand-pull capability`. No anchor
  links or title-quoting cross-refs found pointing at the old
  H1 text, so no other doc needed a matching edit.

### [x] [C, 4.0] templates/skills/iterate.md cites the wrong ship-data.md section — this commit
- fix: changed `templates/skills/iterate.md:85` from "Run
  `skills/ship-data.md` §6 audit inline" to "§7" — `ship-data.md`'s
  `## 6. The procedure` is the commit workflow; "Stale time-bound
  entries" / "Coverage gaps" are actually items 3 and 4 under
  `## 7. Audit pass`.

### [x] [A, 5.4] concepts/skills-anatomy.md's "seven (or eight) skills" count is stale ~2x — this commit
- fix: reworded `concepts/skills-anatomy.md:374` from "The seven
  (or eight) in the nexus templates cover most projects" to "The
  skills already in the nexus templates cover most projects" —
  drops the hardcoded number (currently 15 files in
  `templates/skills/`) that kept drifting instead of trying to
  keep a second count in sync.

### [x] [B/E, 6.3] existing-project.md's overlay copies only `deploy-check.mjs` from `templates/scripts/`, not the whole directory — this commit
- fix: changed the overlay's `fs.cpSync` array entry in
  `playbooks/existing-project.md` §3 from
  `['templates/scripts/deploy-check.mjs','scripts/deploy-check.mjs']`
  to `['templates/scripts','scripts']`, matching
  `new-project.md`'s bulk copy, and dropped the now-redundant
  `fs.mkdirSync('scripts', ...)` call (`cpSync` creates it).
  Brownfield adopters now get `loop-issue.mjs`, `notify.mjs`,
  `bootstrap.mjs`, `lint-migration.mjs`, `stack-lifecycle.mjs`,
  `refresh-critique-session.mjs`, and
  `check-secrets-liveness.mjs` alongside the bulk-copied
  `templates/skills/` and `.claude/settings.json` that already
  assume they exist. `new-project.md`'s existing "Prune
  adopt-by-need files" section (already pointed to by
  `existing-project.md`) already covers pruning the unneeded
  ones, so no new pruning instructions needed.

### [x] [C/F, 1.6] Fictional example deploy URL in `templates/skills/bootstrap.md` now resolves to an unrelated site — this commit
- fix: swapped the sample terminal-output block's example
  hostname at `templates/skills/bootstrap.md:217` from
  `https://ember.vercel.app` (now a real, unrelated live site)
  to `https://your-app.vercel.app`, matching the placeholder
  style already used elsewhere (`https://your-site.netlify.app`
  in `playbooks/new-project.md:242`).

### [x] [A, 4.5] README's own kit tree omits root `CLAUDE.md` — this commit
- fix: added `├── CLAUDE.md` (with a one-line comment on why it
  matters — Claude Code only auto-loads it from repo root) to
  README.md's "What's in this kit" tree, between `AGENTS.md`
  and `package.json` — the one root substrate file the tree
  omitted despite the doc's own "Files added" list (line 170)
  and `templates/README.md`'s tree both already treating it as
  real.

### [x] [A, 1.6] plan/steps/01_build_plan.md's "Carry-overs" section cites stale queue counts — this commit
- fix: reworded both `plan/steps/01_build_plan.md` Carry-overs
  bullets (`plan/AUDIT.md`, `plan/PHASE_CANDIDATES.md`) to point
  at each file's live Pending section instead of a hardcoded
  count, so the two numbers can't go stale between audit passes
  again — the recurring failure mode this row itself kept
  re-triggering.

### [x] [C, 3.6] scripts/verify.mjs's REVERSE_CHECK_DIRS omits templates/plan — this commit
- fix: added `'templates/plan'` to `REVERSE_CHECK_DIRS` in
  `scripts/verify.mjs:165-168`. Re-ran the gate: green, 35 files
  reverse-checked (up from 24), no new failures — closes the
  blind spot that let the `PHASE_CANDIDATES.md`/`CURRENT-STATE.md`
  gap (2026-07-19 digest tick, `[A/C, 3.2]` below) go uncaught by
  the mechanical gate.

### [x] [D, 1.8] README.md:309, 310, 324 has unwrapped bullets breaking the locked wrap rule — this commit (closes #28)
- fix: hard-wrapped the Verify-gate/Deploy-gate bullets
  (`README.md:309-313`) and the `plan/AUDIT.md` state-files
  bullet (`README.md:323-324`) to ~62-64 cols, matching the
  multi-line bullet continuation style already used at
  `README.md:613-624` (2-space-indented continuation lines).

### [x] [A, 2.4] README's own kit tree omits `skills/digest.md` from the collapsed `skills/` enumeration — this commit
- fix: added `skills/digest.md` as its own leaf line in
  `README.md:509-512`'s collapsed `skills/` tree, noting
  "never dispatched by march" (matching `AGENTS.md`'s skill
  table), instead of folding it into the `march.md`
  parenthetical it isn't actually part of.

### [x] [A/E, 2.7] README's "Files added" checklist undersells `scripts/` — this commit (closes #27)
- fix: changed `README.md:170-171`'s "Files added" checklist
  entry from `scripts/deploy-check.mjs` to `scripts/`, matching
  how `plan/` and `skills/` are already collapsed — step 4's
  bulk copy (`['templates/scripts','scripts']`) lands all 8
  scripts, not just `deploy-check.mjs`.

### [x] [A, 4.8] customization/claude-code.md teaches the exact claude_args JSON form march.yml documents as broken — this commit (closes #26)
- fix: changed `customization/claude-code.md:310`'s Model
  routing lever cell from `` claude_args: {"model": "..."} ``
  to the CLI-flag string form, and added a guidance bullet
  citing the production incident where the JSON form silently
  dropped `permissionMode` (model applied; permission mode
  stayed `default`), pointing at `.github/workflows/march.yml`'s
  working `claude_args: >-` block.

### [x] [F, 4.5] templates/.github/CLOUD_LOOP.md cites stale model names "Sonnet 4.6"/"Opus 4.7" — this commit
- fix: changed "Sonnet 4.6" -> "Sonnet 5" and "Opus 4.7" ->
  "Opus 4.8" in both the cost-estimate table and "Upgrading the
  model" section of `templates/.github/CLOUD_LOOP.md`, matching
  the id pinned in `templates/.github/workflows/march.yml:164`
  (`claude-sonnet-5`) and the standing "ids age — check
  `/model`" caveat used elsewhere in the kit. This is the
  template counterpart of the `playbooks/cloud-loop.md:62` fix
  two ticks ago — that fix touched only the internal doc; this
  one is the file adopters actually copy.

### [x] [F/A, 3.6] playbooks/cloud-loop.md:62 cites a stale model name "Sonnet 4.6" — this commit
- fix: changed "Sonnet 4.6" to "Sonnet 5" at
  `playbooks/cloud-loop.md:62`, matching the model id pinned in
  `.github/workflows/march.yml`, `templates/.github/workflows/march.yml`,
  and `customization/claude-code.md`, and added the kit's
  standing "ids age — check `/model`" caveat inline.

### [x] [A/E, 4.0] templates/skills/triage.md hardcodes `blob/main` instead of `<DEFAULT_BRANCH>` — this commit
- fix: replaced `blob/main` with `blob/<DEFAULT_BRANCH>` at
  `templates/skills/triage.md:137`, matching the placeholder
  already used by `templates/skills/plan-a-phase.md:150` and
  `templates/skills/ship-a-phase.md:157,260`. An adopter on a
  non-`main` default branch now gets the same self-healing
  placeholder sweep as those two templates instead of a
  permanently wrong link.

### [x] [B, 4.5] existing-project.md's overlay creates an empty `plan/phases/` with no brief inside it — this commit
- fix: added a paragraph right after the overlay's GitHub-as-DB
  note in `playbooks/existing-project.md` explaining that
  `plan/phases/` lands empty (unlike `new-project.md`'s bulk
  `templates/plan` → `plan` copy) and pointing the reader at
  `new-project.md` §5's brief format, or copying
  `templates/plan/phases/phase_1_bootstrap.md` in as a starting
  point — before §6's "commit the build plan and the first
  phase brief" step assumes one exists.

### [x] [A/E, 4.5] playbooks/new-project.md's placeholder-sweep one-liners omit `./data`, leaving GitHub-as-DB adopters' tokens unresolved — this commit
- fix: added `./data` to both the bash `grep -rl` scope and the
  PowerShell `Get-ChildItem -Recurse` scope in
  `playbooks/new-project.md` §4 (the latter also gets
  `-ErrorAction SilentlyContinue` since `./data` only exists for
  adopters who opted into GitHub-as-DB), and a one-line note in
  the preceding GitHub-as-DB copy paragraph confirming both
  one-liners already cover it. Reproduced in a scratch repo
  before fixing: `templates/data/README.md`'s `<PROJECT>`/
  `<PROJECT_PKG_PREFIX>` tokens survived the documented sweep as
  written. Same bug class as the already-fixed `./scripts`/
  `./.env.example` scope gaps (`plan/CRITIQUE.md` Done log).
  `existing-project.md` doesn't carry its own copy of this
  one-liner — it points to `new-project.md` §4 — so no duplicate
  fix needed there.

### [x] [A/C, 3.2] README's kit-tree omits two real files under `templates/plan/` — this commit
- fix: added `PHASE_CANDIDATES.md` and `CURRENT-STATE.md` (with
  a matching one-line annotation each) to README.md's
  `templates/plan/` tree block, closing the gap against
  `templates/README.md`'s own tree (lines 19, 22) and actual
  disk contents. Left `scripts/verify.mjs`'s
  `REVERSE_CHECK_DIRS` untouched — the suggested mechanical
  catch is a separate, larger change (would need to teach the
  reverse-checker `templates/plan`'s adopt-by-need annotations,
  which its current dirs don't have) and this tick is scoped to
  the one finding.

### [x] [A, 3.2] README.md:381 repeats the stale "six skill files" count — this commit
- fix: reworded both stale occurrences — `README.md:381`-383
  ("the six skill files" → "the skill set") and
  `playbooks/new-project.md:18` ("Six skill files in
  `skills/`" → "The skill set in `skills/` (count varies with
  which adopt-by-need files you keep)"). Closes the matching
  `plan/CRITIQUE.md` LOW row on the same root cause.

### [x] [A, 4.2] README's command table omits `/digest`, `/lessons-pr`, `/moderate` — this commit
- fix: added a `/digest` row to the main command table
  (`README.md`'s "What you get" section) and a `/moderate` row
  to the opt-in table alongside `/ship-asset`. Deliberately
  skipped `/lessons-pr` — it's a nexus-self meta-skill with no
  `templates/skills/` counterpart, never copied to adopter
  repos, so it doesn't belong beside commands adopters actually
  run; the existing forward-reference at `README.md:237` already
  covers it correctly.

### [x] [C, 4.8] `https://thock.netlify.app` 404s — this commit
- fix: replaced all five occurrences of
  `https://thock.netlify.app` with `https://thock.xyz` in
  `README.md:53`, `templates/README.md:87`, and
  `playbooks/new-project.md:98,245,261` — confirmed live via
  curl (netlify domain 404s, `.xyz` returns 200) before editing.

### [x] [A/B, 7.2] existing-project.md's overlay never copies plan/steps/01_build_plan.md, but §6 tells the reader to open it — this commit
- fix: added
  `['templates/plan/steps/01_build_plan.md', 'plan/steps/01_build_plan.md']`
  to the overlay's `cpSync` array in
  `playbooks/existing-project.md`'s §3 command (the
  `mkdirSync('plan/steps')` call next to it only ever made an
  empty directory), and reworded §6's "Open
  `plan/steps/01_build_plan.md` (the template)" to say the
  overlay step already copied it in — same bug class as the
  already-fixed `plan/phases/`/`CLAUDE.md` gaps in
  `new-project.md`, just never mirrored to this brownfield
  playbook.

### [x] [2.1] templates/README.md's sample placeholder one-liner uses variable names that don't match its own 8-entry table — this commit
- fix: deleted the abbreviated, partially-wrong bash sample
  (declared `PROVIDER`/`REPO` vars but the table uses
  `HOSTING_PROVIDER`/`REPO_SLUG`, and it only covered 2 of 8
  placeholders behind an `# ...etc` comment) and pointed
  `templates/README.md` straight at
  `playbooks/new-project.md` §4's exhaustive, correct bash +
  PowerShell one-liners instead of maintaining two copies that
  can drift.

### [x] [3.2] data-layer mermaid diagram is a style outlier — this commit
- fix: both mermaid flowcharts in the kit (README's playbook
  picker, `customization/data-layer.md`'s variant picker) are
  the same shape — a branching decision tree — used
  consistently, not two unrelated one-offs. Kept both as-is and
  formalized the pattern as voice rule 8 in `plan/bearings.md`:
  mermaid `flowchart` is the accepted idiom for decision-routing
  only, prose/tables stay default for everything else.

### [x] [5.6] verify.mjs's tree leg never parses templates/README.md — this commit
- fix: generalized `legTree()`'s fence parser into
  `parseTreeBlock(text, rootLabel, prefix)`, called once for
  `README.md`/`nexus/` (prefix `''`, root IS disk root) and once
  for `templates/README.md`/`templates/` (prefix `'templates'`,
  a real subdirectory). The comment stripper (`stripTreeComment`)
  now cuts at whichever comes first, a bare `#` or a run of 2+
  spaces — needed because `README.md` mixes both single-space-
  before-`#` and double-space-before-`#` styles while
  `templates/README.md` uses `→`/`(...)` after 2+ spaces only.
  Added a reverse disk→tree check (`REVERSE_CHECK_DIRS`:
  `templates/scripts`, `templates/skills`,
  `templates/claude/commands`, `templates/claude/agents`) that
  walks each dir's real files and fails if one is missing from
  both diagrams' entry sets — but only for dirs a diagram
  actually expands per-file; `claude/commands/` and
  `claude/agents/` stay intentionally collapsed to one entry in
  both docs, so they're correctly skipped rather than false-
  flagged. Verified both directions catch induced gaps (an
  untracked probe file under `templates/scripts/`, and a renamed
  tree entry) before reverting the probes.

### [x] [1.8] templates/scripts/__tests__/loop-issue.test.mjs isn't in either layout tree — this commit
- fix: added `│   └── __tests__/loop-issue.test.mjs` to
  `templates/README.md`'s `scripts/` tree block, and the
  equivalent leaf to `README.md`'s own kit tree (a second,
  previously-unreported instance of the identical gap found
  during the 2026-07-11 re-sweep) — both now list the file every
  bulk `scripts/` copy already silently includes.

### [x] [3.5] cloud-loop reference implementation is an external link — this commit
- fix: `playbooks/cloud-loop.md`'s "Reference implementation"
  section now points primarily at this repo's own `.github/`
  (the ouroboros — nexus runs the loop on itself), keeping
  `thock` as the secondary reference instead of the sole link.

### [x] [3.6] plan/steps/01_build_plan.md's Phase log is missing 6 of 18 phases — this commit
- fix: appended phases 9, 10, 11, 13, 15, 17 to the Phase log
  in `plan/steps/01_build_plan.md`, commit order, matching the
  existing one-line style — closing the gap against the 18
  phases the Status block already marks `[x]`.

### [x] [4.2] three onboarding docs claim "six placeholders," templates/README.md's canonical table has eight — this commit
- fix: added `<PROJECT_TAGLINE>` and `<PROJECT_PKG_PREFIX>` to
  `README.md`'s TL;DR placeholder list, `new-project.md`'s §4
  mapping table, both one-liners (bash `grep -rl`/`sed -i` and
  the PowerShell `$repl` hashtable), relabeled "all six" → "all
  eight" in `new-project.md` and `windows-notes.md`, and fixed
  the same stale "all six" in `existing-project.md`'s §3 (same
  root cause, outside the original three-doc citation but
  caught while fixing the others).

### [x] [4.8] heartbeat.yml's alarm text hardcodes a cadence that doesn't match the template's default march.yml cron — this commit
- fix: `templates/.github/workflows/heartbeat.yml:64` no longer
  hardcodes "cadence is 6h" (only true of nexus's own instance
  cron, not the template's mostly-2h default in
  `templates/.github/workflows/march.yml:15`); reworded
  cadence-agnostic: "alarm threshold 14h — check your march cron
  schedule". This repo's own `.github/workflows/heartbeat.yml`
  left untouched (accurate as-is; `ACTIONS_PAT` also cannot push
  `.github/workflows/*.yml` here anyway — same constraint as
  user-issue #12).

### [x] [4.8] templates/README.md's Adopt-by-need table omits two conditional files its own tree comments call out — this commit
- fix: added rows for `.github/workflows/nightly-smoke.yml`
  (adopt when hermetic e2e is in use and `night.yml` doesn't
  already run `SMOKE_SAMPLE=full`) and `scripts/stack-lifecycle.mjs`
  (adopt when hermetic e2e uses Pattern B) to the "Adopt-by-need
  files" table in `templates/README.md`, matching the tree
  comments at lines 62 and 72.

### [x] [3.8] generic-specialist template omits the model: lever — this commit
- fix: added a commented `model:` frontmatter line + a one-line
  guidance comment to
  `templates/claude/agents/generic-specialist.md`, matching the
  per-agent routing lever `customization/claude-code.md` §5
  documents. Used a concrete example id
  (`claude-haiku-4-5`, with the standing "ids age — check
  /model" caveat) instead of a new bracket token, keeping the
  placeholder vocabulary unchanged.

### [x] [4.8] cloud_loop.schedule_cron field is inert, same gap daily_ceiling had — this commit
- fix: added `applyScheduleCron` to
  `templates/scripts/bootstrap.mjs`, same anchor-and-warn
  pattern as `applyDailyCeiling`, wired into `install-workflow`
  right after it. Updated
  `customization/bootstrap-automation.md`'s "GitHub Actions
  workflow quirks" note to describe both fields as wired
  instead of citing the cron line as the still-literal
  precedent.

### [x] [4.9] verify-gate composition drifts across three docs — this commit (closes #16)
- fix: declared the canonical composition + two variance rules
  ("data:validate iff data layer; lint optional leg") once in
  `templates/AGENTS.md`, echoed the lint rule in
  `templates/plan/bearings.md` (also fixing a bare
  `customization/...` path to `nexus/customization/...`), and
  applied both rules explicitly in `customization/verify-gate.md`'s
  web-stack example (data:validate dropped, lint left standalone).

### [x] [6.3] deploy-check.mjs covers 4 of 8 documented providers — this commit (closes #15)
- fix: added `cloudflare-pages`, `render`, and `fly` blocks to
  `templates/scripts/deploy-check.mjs`, porting the patterns
  already documented in `playbooks/ci-providers.md` into the
  same `pollLoop`/`configFail`/`apiFail` contract the other
  providers use. Updated the script's "Supported:" list and the
  playbook's intro line + per-provider snippets to point at the
  template instead of prose-only patterns.

### [x] [6.6] template user-author mechanic teaches a config the action overrides — this commit (closes #14)
- fix: this repo's next few cloud ticks landed authored as
  `nexus` (multiple commits since 2026-07-03), validating the
  env-var mechanic on @v1. `templates/.github/CLOUD_LOOP.md`
  step 3 and `templates/.github/workflows/march.yml` (the
  `Configure git author` step, the `Run /march` env block, and
  prompt item 5) now teach `GIT_AUTHOR_*`/`GIT_COMMITTER_*` env
  vars instead of `git config user.*`.

### [x] [4.2] existing-project audit snippet is crude — commit 1cfab4b
- fix: phase 9 rebuilt the snippet on `git rev-list --count
  HEAD` / `git rev-list --count --since=... HEAD` (cross-shell
  git primitives) instead of `git log | grep -c '^Author:'`.

### [x] [5.4] bootstrap.mjs mixes findstr (Windows) and awk (POSIX) — this commit
- fix: `handoff()`'s `verify` is now `{ describe, check }`;
  `check()` runs `gh api` and tests `stdout.includes(...)` in
  JS instead of piping through `findstr`/`grep`. Same fix
  applied to the Supabase-keys handoff's doc-only verify
  string (no shell pipe at all now).

### [x] [7.2] data-layer.md cites an invented model id — this commit
- fix: `customization/data-layer.md`'s provenance schema
  comment now reads a real id (`claude-opus-4-8`) with the
  kit's standing "ids age — check /model" caveat, matching
  `.github/CLOUD_LOOP.md` and `customization/claude-code.md`.
